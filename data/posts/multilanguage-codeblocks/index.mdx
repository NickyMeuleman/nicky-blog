import {
  FirstAttempt,
  HardCodedTabsAboveCode,
  TabsAboveCode,
  TabsInTitle,
} from "./";

<Aside>

I made a multilingual codeblock component to show the same piece of code
written in different programming languages.

You can see it in action with [an example of The Sieve of
Eratosthenes](/garden/sieve-of-eratosthenes#final-code).

</Aside>

## Proof of concept

I started off simple, and I use that word because I used a package that provides a tab component in React.

Making one myself was a lot more complex than anticipated I had anticipated, so thank you [`@reach/tabs`](https://reach.tech/tabs/).

My first attempt were 3 tabs with hardcoded labels, very fragile, but perfect as proof of concept.

```jsx title=MultiLangCodeBlock.js
import { Tabs, TabList, Tab, TabPanels, TabPanel } from "@reach/tabs";
import "@reach/tabs/styles.css";

const MultiLangCodeBlock = (props) => {
  return (
    <Tabs>
      <TabList>
        <Tab>1</Tab>
        <Tab>2</Tab>
        <Tab>3</Tab>
      </TabList>
      <TabPanels>
        <TabPanel>{props.children[0]}</TabPanel>
        <TabPanel>{props.children[1]}</TabPanel>
        <TabPanel>{props.children[2]}</TabPanel>
      </TabPanels>
    </Tabs>
  );
};
```

I can import that component into a `.mdx` blogpost and pass it an array of 3 items to be rendered.

I can even pass a React component as an array item, it's great.

```mdx title=blogpost.mdx hl=4-6
import { MultiLangCodeBlock } from "./src/components/MultiLangCodeBlock";
import { Hobbits } from "./src/components/Hobbits";

<MultiLangCodeBlock>
  {["They're taking the", "Hobbits to Isengard!", <Hobbits />]}
</MultiLangCodeBlock>
```

The result can be seen below.
Be sure to check out all tabs.

<FirstAttempt>
  {[
    "They're taking the",
    "Hobbits to Isengard!",
    <YouTube youTubeId="uE-1RPDqJAY" skipTo={{ h: 0, m: 0, s: 18 }} />,
  ]}
</FirstAttempt>

## Codeblocks

Let's try to pass a codeblock as an item in that array.

<HardCodedTabsAboveCode>

```js
const language = "JavaScript";
```

```python
language = "Python"
```

```rust
let language = "Rust";
```

</HardCodedTabsAboveCode>

That worked!

Be sure to pass those codeblocks as markdown, not as a literal JavaScript array.

````mdx title=blogpost.mdx
<MultiLangCodeBlock>

```js
const language = "JavaScript";
```

```python
language = "Python"
```

```rust
let language = "Rust";
```

</MultiLangCodeBlock>
````

<Aside variant="danger">

The empty lines before and after each block are significant.  
It's something you need to do in MDXv1 for it to treat the text inside the component as markdown.

</Aside>

### Tab labels

I replaced the hardcoded amount of tabs, and made it so the tab labels were the language from the triple backtick codeblock.

<Aside variant="info">

Remember, the codeblocks are treated as markdown.

I told MDX to use [my own `CodeBlock` component](/blog/theme-ui-syntax-highlighting) every time it sees a triple backtick block in a `.mdx` file.

</Aside>

Using my single language [`CodeBlock` component](/blog/theme-ui-syntax-highlighting) means the fancy options (like highlighting specific lines) work too!

```jsx title=MultiLangCodeBlock.js hl=5-10,14-16
const MultiLangCodeBlock = (props) => {
  return (
    <Tabs>
      <TabList>
        {props.children.map((child) => {
          const [language] = child.props.children.props.className
            .replace(/language-/, ``)
            .split(` `);
          return <Tab>{language}</Tab>;
        })}
      </TabList>

      <TabPanels>
        {props.children.map((child) => {
          return <TabPanel>{child}</TabPanel>;
        })}
      </TabPanels>
    </Tabs>
  );
};
```

<Aside variant="info">

That `child.props.children.props.className` line is a bit hairy.

It's pulling the `className` from that single language codeblock, then turning it into the
language for that codeblock.

</Aside>

This `mdx` will generate the output underneath this block, neat!

````mdx title=blogpost.mdx
<MultiLangCodeBlock>

```js title=index.js numberLines hl=1
const language = "JavaScript";

console.log(language);
```

```python title=index.py numberLines hl=1
language = "Python"

print(language)
```

```rust title=index.rs numberLines hl=1
let language = "Rust";

println!("{}", language);
```

</MultiLangCodeBlock>
````

<TabsAboveCode>

```js title=index.js numberLines hl=1
const language = "JavaScript";

console.log(language);
```

```python title=index.py numberLines hl=1
language = "Python"

print(language)
```

```rust title=index.rs numberLines hl=1
let language = "Rust";

println!("{}", language);
```

</TabsAboveCode>

This doesn't look too bad.

### Buttons inside the codeblock

I wanted the tab buttons to be inside the header of a codeblock, to the right of the title.

The tab buttons being _inside_ the codeblock was a problem.
That meant the button for a tab would be inside the content for a tab, that doesn't sound right.

I decided to manually render my single language `CodeBlock` component without a top part.
The `CodeBlock` component would no longer be responsible for that header, the `MultiLangCodeBlock` would take on that responsability.

The `title` option is what causes the single language component to have a header.
So I prevented that option from reaching the single language block by not passing that title as a prop.

I still want the title to be displayed however, so I have to use that title information in the new `MultiLangCodeBlock`.

That meant I needed a bit of state management to keep track of the current tab index, the title, and the label for that tab.

The `MultiLangCodeBlock` looked great after a little CSS to display the tab buttons to the right of the title and make that entire line _look_ like the top of my single language codeblocks.

```js title=MultiLangCodeBlock.js
const MultiLangCodeBlock = ({ children }) => {
  const codeTitles = children.map(
    (child) => child?.props?.children?.props?.title
  );
  const tabLabels = children.map((child) =>
    child?.props?.children?.props?.className.replace(/language-/, ``).split(` `)
  );

  const [tabIndex, setTabindex] = useState(0);
  const [title, setTitle] = useState(codeTitles[0]);

  const handleTabsChange = (index) => {
    setTabindex(index);
    setTitle(codeTitles[index]);
  };

  return (
    <Tabs index={tabIndex} onChange={handleTabsChange}>
      <div sx={{ display: "flex", variant: `styles.CodeBlock.title` }}>
        <div sx={{ flex: 1 }}>{title}</div>
        <TabList
          sx={{
            color: "mutedText",
            "[data-selected]": { color: "mutedPrimary" },
          }}
        >
          {tabLabels.map((label) => (
            <Tab key={label}>{label}</Tab>
          ))}
        </TabList>
      </div>
      <TabPanels>
        {children.map((child) => {
          // split off title so the CodeBlock from the theme doesn't render a header, this component does that
          const { title, ...blockProps } = child.props.children.props;
          return (
            <TabPanel key={blockProps.className}>
              <CodeBlock {...blockProps} />
            </TabPanel>
          );
        })}
      </TabPanels>
    </Tabs>
  );
};
```
