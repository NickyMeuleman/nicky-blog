The browsers we use to surf the web are amazing pieces of technology.
But they do a lot of work to make it possible for me to watch cat videos.

Over the years, website have gotten orders of magnitude more complicated.
Without going into detail, many sites are now classified as "apps".
They're no longer static documents.
Those sites have to do much more work.

Nowadays, each tab in a browser has its own thread.

<Aside variant="info">

A thread can be thought of as a place in your computer where work happens.
It does one thing at a time.
In [Concurrent vs parallel](/garden/concurrent-vs-parallel) I
explain what the difference is between concurrency and parallellism.

</Aside>

Within that tab, you are bound to that one thread <small>(pretty much)</small> that does <small>nearly</small> **everything**.

It parses the document, executes JavaScript, lays out all things and paints them to the screen.
All these steps take time.

Oh, it also processes user interactions (things like a hover).
It's a lot of work, and we keep adding to it.

A large part of the work is (in)directly caused by executing JavaScript.

## A problem

**JavaScript is a single threaded language.**

That's a problem.

JavaScript was designed around the concept of having access to a single thread.

This greatly simplifies a lot of programming in JavaScript (before writing the post, I had literally never thought about [race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) in JS).
But it also comes with a bunch of downsides.

<Aside variant="info">

Adding threading and shared memory support to everything now would cause a lot of problems.

That's why the concept of shared memory was isolated to a single type: [`SharedArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer).

</Aside>

The biggest downside comes in the form of user experience.

When that main thread is busy, it's can't do anything else, like responding to your clicks or scrolls.

<Aside variant="info">

Browser vendors know this is a problem, so they use threads internally to keep the user experience of browsing the web as smooth as possible.

Some examples:

- [An animated .gif keeps animating in Chromium browsers](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/renderingng-architecture/#threads) because that's handled by a seperate thread.
- [Scrolling with a blocked main thread is still possible](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/03/08/scrolling-on-the-web/) because it's done on a different thread.
- [Some CSS animations keep animating](https://web.dev/non-composited-animations/) with a blocked thread because they are handled on a thread called the "compositor thread".

</Aside>

### Demo

This demo has a button that blocks the main thread for three seconds with a `while` loop.
During the time the browser is blocked, several things are noticible.

1. You can no longer select text
1. The JS Animation froze
1. Your browser cursor, and the hover styles don't change
1. You cannot increment the counter on the page

A second button exists that doesn't fully block the browser for three seconds, but causes what's known as "jank".
It causes some chunks of JavaScript work.
During each chunk, the browser is unresponsive as before, but in between, it can ship a frame and react to user actions.

That is why you can still increment the counter.
The animation doesn't come to a complete standstill, but it has an ugly "start-stop"-behaviour.

<ProblemDemo />

## A solution

In other words, [not threading makes your event listeners sad](https://macarthur.me/posts/use-web-workers-for-your-event-listeners).

Eventhough I just said JavaScript is a single threaded language and doesn't have threads, you can still use multiple threads on the web to do work in parallel!

The browser has the [Web Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) for this.

It's not a JavaScript -the language- thing, it's a browser thing.

A Web Worker executes your code in a new thread that has an entire seperate [execution context](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fd9VaW0M7K4).
You can think of it like a seperate tab without a UI. It shares nothing with the main thread.

It's has its own event loop, but this loop isn't responsible for shipping frames to the browser, only the main thread is.

<Aside variant="success">

This talk about the [event loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCOL7MC4Pl0) is great and I highly recommend watching it.

</Aside>

While blocking the event loop on the main thread will stop new frames from being shipped,
blocking a Web Worker leaves the main thread free to respond to user interaction and ship new frames.

A real-world analogue would be a street with two lanes.
One lane represents the main thread and the second lane represents a web worker.
The second lane is a dedicated bus lane.
When the main lane is blocked, that doesn't affect the buslane and vice versa.

### Demo

The same demo as before, only this time the first two buttons do not affect the main thread, but a worker thread.

The main thread is entirely unaffected.

I promise that a worker thread is doing the same heavy work as the main thread did in the previous demo.
This isn't a magic trick.
Open your system monitor and you will see a jump in CPU usage when you click on a button.

<SolutionDemo />

## How

The [Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/Worker) API has been around for a long time. Since IE10.

[The browser support for web workers](https://caniuse.com/webworkers) is excellent, it's even better than [the browser support for `fetch`](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_fetch).

A worker can be created by passing the path to a seperate JavaScript file to its constructor.

```js title=index.js
const worker = new Worker("./worker.js");
```

Everything in that file will be executed in a seperate thread.
Because of [the required isolation](#a-problem) between the main thread and a worker thread, the threads don't have access to any variables or other code from eachother.

This combined with the fact that workers have an entirely seperate execution context means they don't have access to a bunch of things you expect to "just be there", like the [DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model).
That means web workers can't update the UI directly!

An other result of that isolation is that the threads have to exchange data by passing messages.

This is done through the [`postMessage` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage).
It will copy the message, and fire an event in the other thread with that copied data.

<MainToWorkerChart />

On the main thread, the `postMessage` function is available on that `worker` object you got from calling the `new Worker()` constructor.

In the worker file, `postMessage` is one of the functions global to the worker.

On both sides, you can listen to the `"message"` event this causes.
The data you provided as an argument to `postMessage` will be available on the `.data` property of the event.

To listen to that event, add an [`addEventListener` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener).
On the main thread, that method is available on the worker object.

In the worker, it's the same deal as with `postMessage`.
The `addEventListener` method is available on the [global webworker scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope).

This way, the threads can still communicate with eachother while adhering to that needed strict seperation, great!

This method of using webworkers can be summed up in the same way the [Go programming language](https://go.dev/) approaches multithreading.

> Don't communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating.

>
> </footer>

You can handle different messages with your favourite method of controlling code flow.
In this example, I used a `switch` statement to respond differently to certain messages.

```js title=index.js
const worker = new Worker("./worker.js");
worker.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
  console.log(event.data);
});

worker.postMessage("tick");
```

```js title=worker.js
addEventListener("message", (event) => {
  switch (event.data) {
    case "tic": {
      postMessage("tac");
      break;
    }
    case "ping": {
      postMessage("pong");
      break;
    }
    default: {
      postMessage("A hotdog is a sandwich");
    }
  }
});
```

This example used strings as arguments to `postMessage`, but it can handle way more.

`postMessage` uses the [structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm) to copy the messages.
It can handle a lot!

Even complex data structures like `Set`, `Map`, `Blob`, or cyclical data structures!  
It can't handle functions, trying to copy those will cause an error.
A class will be converted to a standard JavaScript object, losing methods in the process.

<Aside variant="success">

[The `structuredClone()` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/structuredClone) is available directly too!
You can use it to make deep clones of things.

no mo' lodash!

```js
const original = makeLinkedList();
const clone = structuredClone(original);
```

</Aside>

## The main thread is still needed

Sometimes, even if your code doesn't touch the DOM.
You still need to run it on the main thread as a bunch of APIs aren't available in workers.

<Aside variant="info">

[The list of web APIs available in a worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API#supported_web_apis) is quite large.

It doesn't include a bunch of APIs that are available on the main thread though. (eg. `Image`, `Video`, `USB`)
I hope that list grows smaller and smaller as time goes on.
The less I have to think about the difference between code I write for the main thread versus for a web worker, the better.

</Aside>

But because we cannot move everything to a worker doesn't mean we should abandon it altogether for those chunks of work.
A webworker still might be able to perform most of the work before passing off a result to the main thread that then handles the needed mainthread work.

The following example expands on the previous one.
It plays a sound-clip in response to a message of a certain type.

The messages sent to and from the worker are now objects with a `type` property.
This is done to make it possible to send messages with seperate data attached to them.

If you ever worked with the Flux-pattern (like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/usage/reducing-boilerplate#actions)), these messages might seem familiar.

They're actions.
In fact, [the actor model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vg60lf92EkM) is a perfect fit here.

Because `Audio` is one of those APIs that _needs_ the main thread, it is created and listened to on the main thread.
But everything involved in getting the things that audio object needs to be created in the first place is done on the worker thread.

```js title=index.js numberLines hl=4,7,20
const worker = new Worker("./worker.js");

worker.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
  switch (event.data.type) {
    // ...
    case "hiResponse": {
      const audio = new Audio(event.data.audioPath);
      audio.addEventListener("ended", () => {
        console.log("It's quiet...");
      });
      audio.play();
      break;
    }
    default: {
      console.log(event.data);
    }
  }
});

worker.postMessage({ type: "hi" });
```

The callback that is passed to the event listener is now `async` in order to be able to use `await` in combination with the call to `fetch`.

```js title=worker.js numberLines hl=1-2,5,9
addEventListener("message", async (event) => {
  switch (event.data.type) {
    // ...
    case "hi": {
      const res = await fetch("./cereal-is-soup.json");
      const json = await res.json();
      // ...lots of data janitor work here...
      const audioPath = json.audioPath;
      postMessage({ type: "hiResponse", audioPath });
      break;
    }
    // ...
  }
});
```

### Demo

<MainStillNeededDemo />

## Importing packages

Using code you didn't write is ubiquitous.
Web workers originally weren't built with module imports in mind, because modules didn't exist yet.

That changed!

The `Worker` constructor takes an options object where you can specify it will use modules.

You can now use `import` inside a webworker, yay!

```js title=index.js
const worker = new Worker("worker.js", {
  type: "module",
});
```

<Aside variant="info">

The [browser support for module workers](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_worker_worker_ecmascript_modules) is decent, but Firefox is lagging behind.
This is being [actively worked on](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1247687), so expect support soon™.

If you use a bundler for your code like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), ... this will be supported regardless of browser.
If you do not, be aware Firefox (and IE) don't support ESModules in workers.

</Aside>

Expanding on the example again, let's import a heavy [machine vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_vision) library that detects what object is in a photo.

The photo is grabbed from a `canvas` element as an [`ImageData` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageData).

```js title=index.js numberLines hl=1
const worker = new Worker("./worker.js", { type: "module" });

worker.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
  switch (event.data.type) {
    // ...
    case "detectionResult": {
      console.log(
        `There was ${
          event.data.result === true ? "a" : "no"
        } sandwich in this picture`
      );
      break;
    }
    default: {
      console.log(event.data);
    }
  }
});

const input = document.querySelector("input");
const canvas = document.querySelector("canvas");
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

input.addEventListener("change", async (e) => {
  const file = e.target.files[0];
  const bitmap = await createImageBitmap(file);

  canvas.height = bitmap.height;
  canvas.width = bitmap.width;
  ctx.drawImage(bitmap, 0, 0);
  const imageData = ctx.getImageData(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

  worker.postMessage({ type: "isSandwich", imageData });
});
```

```js title=worker.js numberLines hl=1
import { whatIsThis } from "some-machine-vision-library";

addEventListener("message", async (event) => {
  switch (event.data.type) {
    // ...
    case "isSandwich": {
      const item = await whatIsThis(event.data.imageData);
      postMessage({ type: "detectionResult", result: item === "hotdog" });
      break;
    }
    default: {
      postMessage("A hotdog is a sandwich");
    }
  }
});
```

## Performance

Runtime performance is just as important as startup experience.

If your app loads in 0.05ms but stutters on every action I try to take, it's not a performant app.

It might score straight 100s on a [Lighthouse test](https://web.dev/measure/), but using it will suck.

<Aside variant="info">

I know the Google team is actively trying to include metrics that consider runtime performance and that statement was plain wrong.
Now that I've got your attention.
My point is that the web developers seem to be hyperfocused on load performance, sadly often dismissing the importance of runtime performance.

</Aside>

In [a talk from way back in 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCFQu0hK6bU), [Paul Lewis](https://twitter.com/aerotwist) discusses this.

Performance doesn't always mean doing work faster.
I consider a responsive page that does a task slightly slower more performant than a blocked page that completes the task a little faster.

Using more than one thread won't make your app any faster if the logic it uses isn't parallellizable.
On the contrary, calls to `postMessage` aren't magic, they aren't free.

In most cases, using a webworker means moving a chunk of work to a worker thread unchanged.
The overall amount of work will rise slightly due to the added overhead between the worker and the main thread.
The big difference is that the main thread is able to react to user events and ship updated frames while that chunk of work is happening in a worker.

This behaviour has a significant impact on how an app feels.
Sometimes, slower feels faster.

This becomes even more important when you consider the devices your code will run on are unknown to you.

The web is the most accessible UI in the world.

Your code might be ran on a high-end desktop computer, or a low-end smartphone.
A task that took the machine you write code on 5ms to complete might take 100ms on a different device.

You don't know, you **can't** know.

Different screens run at different refresh rates.
60Hz is a very popular frequency for a screen (60 images per second).
But that's far from a universal number.
And guess what, that number determines the time that is available for a frame to either be shown on the screen, or not.

For a 60Hz screen, that's 16.666ms.
Remember, **everything** has to happen inside that timeframe if you want the browser to ship a frame: from running your JS, to calculating the layout, to painting the screen and compositing.

Dropping a frame here and there might not be a big deal, it might even be unnoticable to visitors of the site.
But do it too often and you've got a case of my pick for word of the year: **jank**.

### Load

Remember that time I had that mini-rant about loadtime performance?
Of course you do, it was a paragraph ago.
This is the part where I tell you that you can have your cake and eat it.

When you move logic to a worker thread, you are not only moving execution costs off the main thread.
If that logic uses a module the main thread doesn't need, you're also moving parsing costs off the main thread.

This makes that initial load performance better.
Your UI thread is ready to show something faster: better [First Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/fcp/) and [Time to Interactive](https://web.dev/tti/).

[David East](https://twitter.com/_davideast) dropped [95% of their bundle size](https://davidea.st/articles/firebase-bundle-size/) by loading the heaviest part of their site in a webworker.

### `postMessage`

About that cost of a call to `postMessage`.
[Surma](https://twitter.com/DasSurma) wrote a great post called [is `postMessage` slow](https://surma.dev/things/is-postmessage-slow/).

The TL;DR is: Nope. Payloads up to 10KiB are risk-free. (and 10 kilobytes is quite a lot)

#### Transferring objects

In situations where the message you want to send is huge, calls to `postMessage` can become slow, because copying a huge object takes time.
Thankfully, there is a method to make these calls fast again, very fast, regardless of the message-size.

[Transferable objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Transferable_objects) can be sent to a different thread.
That process is very fast, regardless of the size of the object.

These objects aren't copied.
Instead, a pointer to the same piece of memory is created.

Because the [required isolation](#a-problem) between threads in JavaScript to ensure thread safety,
transferred objects are no longer available to the thread that sent them after they are transferred.

In the last example in this post, we sent an image through `postMessage`.
Because that image could be huge in size, coning all that data would take a large amount of time.
It's a great candidate to be **transferred** instead of copied.

```diff
-   worker.postMessage({ type: "isSandwich", imageData });
+   worker.postMessage({ type: "isSandwich", imageData }, [
+   imageData.data.buffer,
+ ]);
```

## It's time to stop

A great feature of webworkers is the ability to stop them at a whim.
No. Really.

A webworker might be responsible for a type of work that can block an entire thread while an algorithm crunches numbers.

If a new input from the main thread comes in that causes the same work, a blocked thread won't be able to start until it's done with the previous work.

That's where a [`.terminate()` on the worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker/terminate) comes in.
It can be called on the main thread and stops a webworker regardless of what it's doing.
In the middle of a million long for-loop? Don't care, it will stop the webworker immediately.

That means a partially done heavy calculation that became useless because of a new user input can be stopped, saving wasted CPU cycles.

A neat pattern is terminating a worker that's busy and spinning up a new identical one with the new input.

A way to stop the worker from within itself exists on the global scope of the worker called [`close`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope/close).
It's annoying these two methods don't have the same name, but, eeeeh, web standards are weird sometimes.

## show progress

Performing a large task in a webworker provides the opportunity to show the user that something is happening.

While a multi-second calculation is happening, the webworker can periodically call `postMessage`.
The main thread is then free to display those updates to the screen.
Be it in the form of a progress bar or partially rendered picture.

If that task was done on the main thread, the UI would be frozen, and there would be no indication anything is really happening.
(No, a CSS spinner you started before the operation doesn't count.)

### Demo

In this demo, a button starts a three second long while loop that increments a counter.

The web worker sends a message with the progress so far every 50,000 ticks.

```js title=worker.js
addEventListener("message", (msg) => {
  let count = 0;

  const startTime = Date.now();
  while (Date.now() < startTime + 3000) {
    count += 1;

    // communicate progress
    if (count % 50_000 === 0) {
      postMessage(count);
    }
  }
  // final count
  postMessage(count);
});
```

The message listener on the main thread updates the UI with the received number.

Trying to do the same thing on the main thread would block the thread, preventing any updates from being shown.

<ProgressDemo />

TODO: something about WASM, XState, a conclusion of some sort.

put more into workers: entire state. State can be seperate from the UI.

## Do it

Go and use workers!
