TL;DR

1. Add [`remark-math`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-math).
2. Intercept the math and render it with [`react-katex`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@matejmazur/react-katex).

Show me a minimal [code example](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/gatsby-mdx-math-example).

I'd like to see [a demo](https://nickymeuleman.github.io/gatsby-mdx-math-example/) of that code example in action!
</Aside>

I wanted to add support to display equations on my blog.
A popular tool to achieve this is [KaTeX](https://katex.org/).

The goal is being able to write a string in the TeX syntax inside a `.mdx` file,
and a pretty math equation showing up on the rendered page.

My blog uses [`gatsby-plugin-mdx`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx) to be able to use `.mdx` files.

To achieve the goal of writing KaTeX blocks in MDX and getting pretty equations to show up, several things need to happen.

[`gatsby-plugin-mdx`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx) allows you to pass plugins it will use internally.  
We'll use that to "make pretty math happen" ðŸ’…!

## Pinpoint the math sections in mdx

The first step is getting the MDX toolchain to recognize the math inside a `.mdx` file.

I used the [`remark-math`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-math) plugin for this.
It takes your markdown, looks for the relevant math sections, and marks them as such.

An inline math section is opened with a single dollar sign, and ended by an other single dollar sign `$`.  
A math section that should be a block (so: it should start on a new line) is opened and closed by double dollar signs `$$`.

```mdx title=index.mdx numberLines
Some math on the same line: $T_n = a + (n-1)d$

Or, some math in a block

$$
T_n = a + (n-1)d
$$
```

The way markdown works has to do with [Abstract syntax trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree).
They're terribly complex at times, but they're also very fascinating and extremely powerful tools.

[`remark-math`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-math) manipulates that tree in such a way that your inline math turns into an `inlineMath` node,
and your block math turns into a `math` node.

At the end of the MDX pipeline, HTML is rendered.

- The inline math blocks will turn into `span`s with a class of `math-inline`.
- A math block will turn into a `div` with a class of `math-display`.

The content of those HTML-elements will be a string with the [TeX](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html) you wrote in the `.mdx` file.

So `$T_n = a + (n-1)d$` turns into `<span class="math math-inline">T_n = a + (n-1)d</span>`

While the block

```mdx title=index.mdx numberLines
$$
T_n = a + (n-1)d
$$
```

Turns into `<div class="math math-display">T_n = a + (n-1)d</div>`

### Wiring up remark-math

<Aside variant="danger">
Make sure to install version 3 of [`remark-math`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-math) if you are using [`gatsby-plugin-mdx`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx).
Internally, the mdx plugin uses version 10 of [`remark`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark), while version 4 of [`remark-math`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-math) requires version 13 of [`remark`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark).

YAY dependencies!

```bash
npm i remark-math@3.0.1
```
</Aside>

Install the [`remark-math`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-math) plugin, and add it to the configuration option of [`gatsby-plugin-mdx`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx) in [`gatsby-config.js`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/).

```js title=gatsby-config.js hl=7 numberLines
module.exports = {
  // --- snip ---
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-plugin-mdx",
      options: {
        remarkPlugins: [require("remark-math")],
      },
    },
    // --- snip ---
  ],
};
```

## Doing something with that information

There are several ways to continue from here.
Wichever way you choose, adding the required KaTeX CSS file whenever math is rendered is crucial.

<Aside variant="danger">
The KaTeX CSS file needs to be imported on a page to render the math correctly.

You can do this manually in every mdx file, or once in a layout file, or in [`gatsby-browser.js`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/),...

For example, via the import style in a `.mdx` or `.js` file

```js
import "katex/dist/katex.min.css";
```

Or via the require style inside [`gatsby-browser.js`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/)

```js
require("katex/dist/katex.min.css");
```

Or a `<link>` tag in an HTML file:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.12.0/dist/katex.min.css"
  integrity="sha384-AfEj0r4/OFrOo5t7NnNe46zW/tFgW6x/bCJG8FqQCEo3+Aro6EYUG4+cU+KJWu/X"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
/>
```
</Aside>

### Option 1: a Rehype plugin

While a remark plugin like [`remark-math`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-math) does work on the <abbr title="Abstract syntax tree">[AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)</abbr> of the mdx **before** it turned into HTML.

A rehype plugin does work **after** that HTML is generated and changes it.

You can use [`rehype-katex`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-katex) for this.

It takes in those `<span class="math-inline">` and `<div class="math-display">` and turns the string of KaTeX you wrote
into something that's ready to be rendered into a beautiful equation.
It just needs some of that CSS.

#### Wiring up rehype-katex

Install the [`rehype-katex`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-katex) plugin,
and add it to the configuration option of [`gatsby-plugin-mdx`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx) inside the [`gatsby-config.js`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-config/) file.

```bash
npm i rehype-katex
```

```js title=gatsby-config.js hl=8 numberLines
module.exports = {
  // --- snip ---
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-plugin-mdx",
      options: {
        remarkPlugins: [require("remark-math")],
        rehypePlugins: [require("rehype-katex")],
      },
    },
    // --- snip ---
  ],
};
```

If you chose option 1, you're done!
Pretty math, yay!

### Option 2: a React component

I like the React workflow, so this is the option I chose.

It's a bit more flexible, Should I ever want to use it outside of mdx, I can.

I take in those `<span class="math-inline">` and `<div class="math-display">` elements,
and give the string they contain to a React component to render correctly.

The React package I went with is [@matejmazur/react-katex
](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@matejmazur/react-katex).
It has a `<TeX />` component that can turn the string of raw KaTeX into a form that's ready to turn into a pretty equation on your screen.

<Aside variant="info">
I also chose this method because I wanted to create a custom component.
Make it pop âœ¨ with some custom CSS, and add some extra features like giving a math block a title.
</Aside>

#### Using `react-katex`

MDX allows you to intercept the HTML that gets rendered and add to, or replace it.

This is the mechanism I used to intercept those `<span class="math-inline">` and `<div class="math-display">` tags,
and give the contents to the `<TeX />` component.

The [`<MdxProvider />`](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started#mdxprovider) component from [`@mdx-js/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mdx-js/react) allows this.
If you already have one of those in your app that wraps the `.mdx` files you want to write math in, great!

If not, you can add one in Gatsby's [`wrapRootElement`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/#wrapRootElement) in both [`gatsby-browser.js`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-browser/) and [`gatsby-ssr.js`](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-ssr/).
Or, in the [layout component](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-mdx/#default-layouts) the `.mdx` file will use.

_Yes, I know, there are **a lot** of moving parts here._

```jsx title=MdxLayout.js numberLines
import React from "react";
import TeX from "@matejmazur/react-katex";
import { MDXProvider } from "@mdx-js/react";

const components = {
  div: (props) => {
    if (props.className.includes("math-display")) {
      import("katex/dist/katex.min.css");
      return <TeX block math={props.children} />;
    }
    return <div {...props} />;
  },
  span: (props) => {
    if (props.className.includes("math-inline")) {
      import("katex/dist/katex.min.css");
      return <TeX math={props.children} />;
    }
    return <span {...props} />;
  },
};

export default function MdXLayout(props) {
  return <MDXProvider components={components}>{props.children}</MDXProvider>;
}
```

## Demo

For this blog, I chose the option that uses a React component.

I created a specialized `<MathBlock />` component that handles math blocks,
and gives it some extra capabilities you can specify inside mdx, by adding options next to the opening `$$`.

<Aside variant="success">
Pretty math blocks that look like my code blocks! âœ¨âœ¨
</Aside>

Inline math expressions are sent straight to the `<TeX />` component.

$a$ = first item  
$l$ = last item  
$n$ = amount of items  
$d$ = common difference

Input:

```mdx title=index.mdx numberLines
Some inline math, coming right up. $T_n = a + (n-1)d$
```

Output:

Some inline math, coming right up. $T_n = a + (n-1)d$

### Using a `MathBlock` explicitly

The MathBlock component can be used in two ways,
either by passing a KaTeX string to the `math` prop,
or by including the KaTeX string in between the opening and closing tags.

#### Via the `math` prop.

Input:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```mdx title=index.mdx numberLines
import { MathBlock } from "./../src/components/MathBlock";
<MathBlock title="Arithmetic progression sum" math="S_n = \frac{n(a + l)}{2}" />
```

Output:

<MathBlock title="Arithmetic progression sum" math="S_n = \frac{n(a + l)}{2}" />

#### Via `children`.

Input:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```mdx title=index.mdx numberLines
import { MathBlock } from "./../src/components/MathBlock";
<MathBlock title="Arithmetic progression sum">
{"S_n = \\frac{n(2a + (n-1)d)}{2}"}
</MathBlock>
```

Output:

<MathBlock title="Arithmetic progression sum">
{"S_n = \\frac{n(2a + (n-1)d)}{2}"}
</MathBlock>

<Aside variant="danger">
Notice I had to pass the math as a JavaScript string by opening and closing curly brackets:  
`{"math here"}`

Because `\` is the escape character in JavaScript, but the LaTeX needs it, I had to escape it with an additional `\`:  
`\\frac`
</Aside>

### Using `$$` signs in mdx

#### A vanilla block

Input:

```mdx title=index.mdx numberLines
$$
S_n = \frac{n(2a + (n-1)d)}{2}
$$
```

Output:

$$
S_n = \frac{n(2a + (n-1)d)}{2}
$$

#### With a meta string

Input:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```mdx title=index.mdx numberLines
$$ title=Arithmetic-progression-sum
S_n = \frac{n(a + l)}{2}
\newline
S_n = \frac{n(2a + (n-1)d)}{2}
$$
```

Output:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
$$ title=Arithmetic-progression-sum
S_n = \frac{n(a + l)}{2}
\newline
S_n = \frac{n(2a + (n-1)d)}{2}
$$

<Aside variant="info">
Because of the method I chose to parse that string after the opening `$$`,
the `title` value is not able to have spaces in it.
I could rectify this with a little effort,
but I'm happy with the way it is right now.
</Aside>
