Positioning things on the web.
I'm bad at writing intros, let's dive in.

## Document flow

**flow** is the way we refer to the browser laying out all elements when there are no changes made to those elements.

Every element has a natural size, and **elements in flow affect the location of the elements around it**.

Boxes in normal flow are either block or inline, but not both at the same time.

Inline ones sit in the same direction as text.
Block ones are stacked along the cross axis.

<Aside variant="info">

The [`display` CSS property](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/visuren.html#propdef-display) can set this.

```css
p {
  display: block;
}

span {
  display: inline;
}
```

[Flexbox and grid _containers_ still participate in this block and inline layout.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flow_Layout/Block_and_Inline_Layout_in_Normal_Flow#the_display_property_and_flow_layout)
That is why you can set the `display` property to both `flex` and `inline-flex`.
Or to `grid` and `inline-grid`.

Or, if you like the [two value display syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display#syntax): `display: block flex;` and `display: inline flex`.

</Aside>

There are 2 popular methods to take an element out of flow.

- absolute positioning, which we discuss later
- floating an element

## Position

The default value for [the CSS `position` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) is `static`.
That's why you almost never see it written in code, when a `position` is set explicitly, it's usually with an other value.

The most important aspect is if the item gets taken out of [flow](#document-flow) or not.

Values for `position` that keep the element it is applied to in the document flow:

- `static`
- `relative`
- `sticky`

Values for `position` that remove the element from the document flow:

- `absolute`
- `fixed`

Positioned elements can be offset by also defining a value for the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties with a distance.

In relation to what those defined offsets apply is determined by the value you chose for `position`.

<Aside variant="info">

Elements with `position: static;` are positioned according to the normal document flow.
The `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties don't have an effect.

They are about as useful as [Radioactive man's goggles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkaBT-u7qn8), so, not at all.

_The offsets, they do nothing_

</Aside>

### Relative

Relatively positioned elements remain in flow.
They are offset relative to their original position.

<Aside variant="info">

Elements with `position: sticky` are offset relative to nearest scrolling
ancestor.

That enables [a bunch of neat applications](https://mastery.games/post/position-sticky/)
