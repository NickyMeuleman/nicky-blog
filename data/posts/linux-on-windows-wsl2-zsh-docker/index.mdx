Compromises are great. When it comes to technology, having your cake and eating it too is better.

The machine I normally use for development broke.
The [Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/announcing-wsl-2/) just came out, so I decided to set up another machine with that.

When all was said and done, it was nothing short of awesome. I just booted a full-stack application that uses [docker](https://www.docker.com/) from an [Oh My ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) terminal window inside of [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
It booted faster than it ever had natively on Windows.

I'm using Windows 10 Home, that means the [hyper-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-V) virtualization technology normally isn't available. But <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2">WSL2</abbr> lets you take advantage of it anyway (if your hardware supports it).

This post describes the steps I went through to set that up.

It's going to be a long one, so buckle up! ðŸ’ª

## Update Windows 10

To use <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2">WSL2</abbr>, Windows 10 has to be updated to version 2004 (Build 10941) or higher.

- Run Windows update

- Check your Windows version by opening the "Run" dialog (Windows key + R) and entering `winver`.

![Windows version](winver.png)

<Aside variant="info">

If the update to Windows 10, version 2004 (Build 19041) is not yet available
in Windows update, manually installing the latest version is possible via the
[Windows 10 Update
Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10).

</Aside>

## Activate optional features

<abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux version 1">
  WSL1
</abbr> and <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2">WSL2</abbr> use some
features that aren't activated by default, enabling those is necessary.

This is possible through a <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>, by going to "turn Windows features on or off" or through an elevated Powershell prompt.

- The GUI option:

![Turn Windows features on or off](features-search.png)

To use <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux">WSL</abbr>, enable the aptly named "Windows Subsystem for Linux" feature.

![Windows Subsystem for Linux feature](feature-wsl.png)

- Through Powershell:

```bash
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```

Regardless of the option you chose, a reboot is required.

### Feature for WSL2

That was enough for <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux version 1">WSL1</abbr>.
To use <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2">WSL2</abbr>, also make sure virtualization is enabled in your <abbr title="Basic input/output system">BIOS</abbr>.

<Aside variant="info">

WSL2 uses the [hyper-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-V) technology. That technology is normally only available
on Windows 10 pro, but Windows 10 home can also take advantage of it for WSL2.

</Aside>

Enabling virtualization in the BIOS looks different for most motherboard brands.  
On my MSI board the option was called "Virtualization Technology" and was hidden in the overclocking settings.

Next: enabling another optional feature in Windows!

Same story here, either use the GUI or an elevated Powershell window.  
The option to enable is called the "virtual machine platform".

- GUI

![virtual machine platform feature](feature-virtual-machine-platform.png)

- Powershell

```bash
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName VirtualMachinePlatform
```

## Install a distro

Once that reboot is done, you can go to the Microsoft store and install your favourite Linux distribution. I went with Ubuntu, because a lot of install instructions and other documentation are written for that distro.

![Ubuntu in the Microsoft store](store-ubuntu.png)

On the first boot of the distro you just installed (which presents itself as a terminal window), you'll be asked to enter a password for when you want to **do** stuff as a **su**per user (`sudo`).

## WSL1 to WSL2

To check which version of <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux">WSL</abbr> is installed you can run a command in Powershell.

```bash
wsl --list --verbose
# or
wsl -l -v
```

If the number for the version is 2, all systems go!

If not, convert that puppy from 1 to 2.

```bash
wsl --set-version <distro-name> 2
# in my case
wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2
```

The output will tell you that this operation might take a while.  
It's not one of those that says that only to finish 5 seconds later. It took about 10 minutes here.

![Converting a distro from WSL1 to WSL2](wsl-set-version.png)

At this point, <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2">WSL2</abbr> is ready to go.  
Opening the distro you installed will show a bash prompt.

Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 comes with a real Linux kernel.  
Previously there was a kernel compatibility layer that could not do quite as much.

In the words of a certain wooden puppet, it is now a _real boy_.

![Pinocchio is a real boy](https://i.imgur.com/fLW42gG.jpg)

Users of <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2">WSL2</abbr> are encouraged to place their files inside the Linux file system.  
That way they benefit from file performance increases compared to <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux version 1">WSL1</abbr>.

In <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2">WSL2</abbr> you can now access files from Linux in Windows and the other way around.  
Modifying Linux files from Windows in <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux version 1">WSL1</abbr> was always warned against, as this could cause _bad things_ to happen. Whoooo, spooky ðŸ‘» (but, really, it was a bad idea.)

More details on changes are available in Microsoft's [WSL2 release blogpost](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl-2-is-now-available-in-windows-insiders/)

## Installing tools

Let's start loading up our environment with some needed tools.
A few tools still need to be installed on the Windows side, the rest are all Linux tools.

The two I'll install for Windows are: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/).
Remember to set the autocrlf setting to input for git. VSCode handles it well.

<Aside>

Open a terminal in Windows!

</Aside>

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

Before beginning to install Linux tools, we'll update our already installed packages.

<Aside>

From this point on, the action happens in your Linux terminal!

</Aside>

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

More preparation, installing build tools for [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp)

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential
```

### Git

This one should also be installed on the Linux side.

```bash
sudo apt install git
```

After installing git, remember to [configure it](/blog/fresh-development-environment-part-2/#configuration).  
Especially setting the autocrlf setting to input is important here.

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

### Node & NPM

You can install it as a standalone package.

Now we can harness all those Linux-y tools, I'll use <abbr title="node version manager">nvm</abbr> instead to make using different versions easier.

[The nvm repo](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) has excellent installation instructions.

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
```

Restart your terminal after the install.  
To confirm the installation was successfull:

```bash
command -v nvm
```

It should return: `nvm`  
That's all, no version number, just that string.

To install the latest the latest stable version of node:

```bash
nvm install node # "node" is an alias for the latest version
```

When node releases a new version, you can run that same command again.

You'll need to tell nvm which version of node you want to use.  
So next time you boot your Linux distro, you'll have to use.

```bash
nvm use node
```

When the project you are working on requires a different version of node, specify that one.

```bash
nvm use v<version number>
# or if the project has a valid .nvmrc file
nvm use
```

Having to do that manually seems annoying right?  
Many solutions to this annoyance exist. Later in this post that annoyance will be dealt with.

### Docker

- Kick things off by updating the packages index and installing dependencies.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common
```

- Add Dockers's official GPG-key.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

- Verify this by running:

```bash
sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
```

You should see the full key in the output.

```
9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88
```

- Add the Docker repository to your list of repositories.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
```

- Update the list of repositories again and install Docker CE.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce
```

Normally, the docker engine starts automatically after the install.  
For me that was not the case so I started it manually.

```bash
sudo service docker start
```

- Verify Docker CE was installed correcly by booting up their hello-world container.

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

### Docker Compose

As a handy tool for managing docker containers, `docker-compose` is frequently installed alongside `docker-ce`.

- Download the current stable release and place it in the `/usr/local/bin` folder.

```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.24.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

- Make the file executable.

```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

- Verify the installation.

```bash
docker-compose --version
# output: docker-compose version 1.24.0, build 0aa59064
```

### Docker Desktop

A short trip back to the Windows side!

The previous way to _do Docker-y things_ all happened through the Linux terminal.
While this is fine, the [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) application integrates with <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2">WSL2</abbr> quite well and provides a <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>.

![Installing the Docker Desktop application](docker-desktop-install.png)

If you start a docker container in your (Linux) terminal, it will appear in, and can be controlled through the interface.

e.g. Running the getting-started docker container in the Linux terminal

```bash
docker run -dp 80:80 docker/getting-started
```

will make the container appear in the interface, where it can be opened in a browser, stopped, restarted, ...

![The container we started appears in the interace.](docker-desktop-dashboard.png)

### Yarn

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is a package manager for JavaScript made by Facebook.

<Aside variant="danger">

The process described below will install yarn1.
For yarn2 refer to [this official guide](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

</Aside>

- Add their gpg key.

```bash
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

- Add their repository.

```bash
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
```

- Update the list of repositories and install Yarn.

<Aside variant="info">

Skip installing node with `--no-install-recommends` if you are using `nvm` or a similar tool.

</Aside>

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends yarn
```

- Verify the installation.

```bash
yarn --version
```

### Visual Studio Code Remote - WSL extension

The [Visual Studio Code Remote - WSL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) extension will let you use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on Windows to interact with <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux">WSL</abbr>.
You can develop entirely in the Linux environment, while viewing the results in Windows.

Below is a screenshot of me writing this blogpost in VSCode, while connected to my Ubuntu installation.
Notice the `WSL: Ubuntu` badge in the lower left corner.

![Me writing this blogpost in VSCode](vscode-remote-wsl.png)

<Aside variant="info">

VSCode wil automatically connect to your <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux">WSL</abbr> instance when you launch VSCode from Linux.  
e.g. opening a folder with `code .`

</Aside>

## A better terminal

When you open your terminal there are 2 sides at work.  
The thing you see and type into, **the terminal**.  
The thing that terminal communicates with and does most of the work, **the shell**.

<Aside variant="info">

Scott Hanselman [explains the difference](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/WhatsTheDifferenceBetweenAConsoleATerminalAndAShell.aspx).

</Aside>

Let's face it, the terminal that ships with Windows is pretty lackluster.  
Good news: they are ~~coming~~ came out with [a new one](https://youtu.be/8gw0rXPMMPE) and it looks really awesome!

~~In anticipation of that release, I'm not going to change much there. I'll use the one that's integrated into VSCode most of the time anyway.~~

<Aside variant="success">

The Windows Terminal released, and it's awesome.
At least, [I think so](/blog/windows-terminal).

</Aside>

### Change integrated VSCode terminal

VSCode's integrated terminal is a great productivity booster.  
Let's use the brand new Linux shell in there.

When opening the integrated terminal, you can choose wich one to use as the default one.  
Select <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux">WSL</abbr> from the resulting list of options and you are done!

![select terminal in Visual Studio Code](terminal-select.png)

Alternatively, edit the `settings.json` to point to the correct location.

```json
"terminal.integrated.shell.linux": "/bin/sh",
```

### ZSH

I chose [ZSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) to replace the standard bash shell that opens when clicking the Ubuntu icon in the start menu.

Installing it is a oneliner thanks to the package manager in Ubuntu.

```bash
sudo apt install zsh
```

When you launch Ubuntu, you'll still see the usual bash prompt.  
To start the zsh shell from that familiar bash prompt, enter:

```bash
zsh
```

The first time this launches, a configuration wizard will be shown.  
The choice made here doesn't matter all that much, since the resulting file `.zshrc` file will be overwritten when we install [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) a bit later. I chose the option `2` anyway and went with the defaults.

![zsh-install](zsh-install.png)

Typing `zsh` into bash every time we launch it gets old quick.  
Time to change the default shell to zsh!

```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

_Thanks to Reddit user_ [bhramchari](https://www.reddit.com/r/bashonubuntuonwindows/comments/c1fy1c/stock_win10_to_wsl2_ubuntu_with_zsh_and_docker/erdckwe/) _for suggesting this method!_

### Oh My ZSH

This extension to zsh has one of the best URLs out there: [ohmyz.sh](https://ohmyz.sh/)  
It will also enable a huge list of nice features, which is more important.

Installing oh-my-zsh is a oneliner.

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

This will also replace that `.zshrc` file we initialised earlier.

Enjoy the cool ASCII art signalling a successful installation!

#### Theme oh-my-zsh

oh-my-zsh comes with lots of fancy themes, so let's install a pretty one!  
Take a look at [a list of them](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes).

I like the agnoster one, so that's what I'll go with.

Edit the `.zshrc` file to enable it.  
This file is also located in your Linux home directory (`cd $home` to go there).

```bash title=.zshrc
# change the default theme
ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"
# to the chosen theme
ZSH_THEME="agnoster"
```

restart your terminal for it to take effect.

#### Powerline fonts

Aaaaaaaaaah, it's ... broken. ðŸ˜¥

![ugly oh my ZSH](ugly-oh-my-zsh.png)

That's partly because this is a fancy prompt that needs a [Powerline-patched font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) to render correctly.

You can either download the specific font you want and install it that way (double clicking on the file and hitting the install button), or use the install script to install them all at once.

To install them all at once first clone that repo.  
Then open an elevated Powershell window.  
To be able to execute the `install.ps1` file, we need to open up the execution policy temporarily.

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

Now navigate to the cloned repo and execute the install script.

```bash
.\install.ps1
```

You'll see the same thing happening as you would when downloading and installing each font seperatly, but of course much quicker.

<Aside variant="danger">

Don't forget to close down the execution policy again immediately after installing the fonts!

</Aside>

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy Default
```

After installing the fonts, setting them in your terminal application changes the weird boxes to icons.

Note that the standard terminal in Windows still doesn't work quite right after that. It has many limitations, this not working completely is just one of them.  
As stated before, I'm mainly going to use the terminal inside VSCode, so I'm leaving the standard terminal behind.

After setting the terminal font in VSCode, all icons show up beautifully.

The colors when listing directories and files with the `ls` command still look, euuuhm, suboptimal.

![ugly dircolors](ugly-dircolors.png)

#### dircolors

To replace those ugly colors, something called dircolors may be used.  
I'll install the popular [solarized dircolors](https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized)

Pick the theme you want and download the file to your home directory.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized/master/dircolors.ansi-dark --output ~/.dircolors
```

Add a line to the bottom of your zsh configuration file to use what you just downloaded.

```bash
# load dircolors
eval `dircolors ~/.dircolors`
```

Much better, it looks great now!

![pretty-terminal](pretty-terminal.png)

### Plugins for oh-my-zsh

By itself, oh-my-zsh is already feature-rich. For further productivity increases, plugins are there to help.

Many of those plugins ship alongside oh-my-zsh, making installing them as easy as adding a line to `.zshrc`.  
Others require a bit more effort, let's start with those!

#### Syntax Highlighting

[zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) is a handy plugin that prevents syntax errors by highlighting valid commands in green and invalid ones in red.

To install the plugin first clone [the repo](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting).  
Then add the script to your `.zshrc`.

```bash title=.zshrc
source <path-to-the-script>
# I cloned the repo to the .zsh folder, so for me it was
source ~/.zsh/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
```

#### Auto Suggestions

[zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) makes typing the same command over and over much quicker by suggesting what you could type next. These suggestions are based on command history.

Installing it follows the same pattern as the plugin we installed above.

First clone the repo, then add a line to `.zshrc`

```bash title=.zshrc
source <path-to-the-script>
# I cloned the repo to the .zsh folder, so for me it was
source ~/.zsh/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
```

#### pre-installed plugins

A list of the plugins that ship with oh-my-zsh can be viewed on this [Github page](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins).

Each one should have a `README.md` that tells you more about what it does and how to activate the plugin.  
Most of the time, activating the plugin requires you to add it to the list of plugins in `.zshrc`.

This is what I ended up with:

```bash title=.zshrc
plugins=(
    git
    node
    npm
    npx
    nvm
    z
)
```

The plugin I would like to call out here is [z](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/z).  
It make navigating to _frecent_ folders easy.

You read that right, it's not a typo.  
It's a contraction of frequent and recent.

For example, my blog is located at `~/projects/nicky-blog`  
If I type `z blog`, z will take me there.

## Result

Whew! That was quite the journey ðŸ˜…ðŸ’¦  
The result is very powerful, and it looks good too! ðŸŽŠðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ

![the end result](end-result.png)
