TL;DR: Error messages are useful. **Read them.**

_"Error messages are pretty scary, right?"_

If you answered with "yes", I'd like to convince you of the opposite.

## Oh, no!

Error messages were something that I did _not_ want to see.
They indicated I did something wrong, that my code was bad and I should feel bad.

That was **wrong**.

While errors used to exclusively cause a sense of dread and frustration. Now they are often a source of relief, an answer to questions, ...

Don't get me wrong. They're still a source of frustration sometimes, and lots of it. Especially when one error is the thing that's preventing you from making progress.

The most annoying error messages are the ones that don't tell you anything other than "Stuff broke".

## Gather information

When you see error messages, **READ THEM**.

Error messages are an invaluable tool to help you figure out what went wrong.
They are not only telling you there is an issue, they are the first step to fixing that issue too!

<Tweet tweetLink="waterproofheart/status/1298940388959490048" theme="dark" />

Error messages often contain a lot of relevant info. If they don't tell you exactly what's wrong or how to fix it, good ones will at least point you in the right direction.

When presented with an error message, extract as much information as possible from it.
Make an effort to understand what it's telling you.

### Again, and again

You will read code more than you write code.
For error messages, this is even more true.
(How can something be more true than true? That's not possible. These questions keep me awake at night.)

Learn by having lots of exposure to errors.
That's how I learn most about programming, by making mistakes, by deliberately breaking things.

Being perfect and following tutorials doesn't expose you to all the errors.
Those hold valuable [understanding](https://swizec.com/blog/why-understanding-beats-knowledge/).

### Context

Context is important.
The more context you have, the better.

- What language are you using, what framework.
- The specific version of that framework.
- Are you on Windows, Mac, Linux, ...
- Which browser are you using.
- ~~What did you eat for breakfast?~~

A lot of that information might not be relevant to the exact problem you're having, but more information is often better than less.

That's why a lot of open source projects require you to provide this information when you submit a bug.
It _might_ be relevant.

If you know a lot about what you are doing, the source of an error message may be clear to you.
Whereas if you dive in, the error message might have been indecipherable. This ties into the next tip, keeping the feedback loop short.

### Keep the feedback loop short

Try to keep the time between writing code, and discovering an error that code caused as short as possible.
The moment right after you write a bug, is the best moment to see the error it caused. It's the moment where you'll have the most context.

Luckily, a lot of workflows include tools to provide you with feedback as quickly as possible.

In web development, that might take the form of an automatically reloading web browser, showing you the results of the code you wrote.
That might be with [browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/), or a fancy setup with [React Native fast refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).  
What matters is the code you just wrote is getting executed and you will be presented with any errors it may cause quickly.

React has some useful errors.

<Tweet tweetLink="AdamRackis/status/1163912550087647235" theme="dark" />

The React framework has some really helpful errors.
If you try to pass an asynchronous function to `useEffect`, a helpful error message will tell you

> That big fat error is actually really helpful:

One of the big bullet points for a major version release was "better error experience".

Sticking with it, effort to understand what errors mean. Learn by having lots of exposure to errors.
That's how you learn most programming, by making mistakes. Being perfect/following tutorials doesn't expose you to all the errors. Those hold valuable understanding (Swizec blogpost)

TypeScript errors are terrible?
Not because of their content, but because of how they are formatted when we see them -pic of LONG type error in VSCode-
You'll see more errors during development, in your IDE
but less during runtime, in the browser console -look up stats-

```error

Found 5 errors.
```

</Aside>

Unhelpful errors at first sight.
Using lots of stylign with "sx" and this is wrong, why?

Pointed me to.

```jsx title=BlogPostListPage.tsx
<ul
    sx={{
        display: `grid`,
        gridTemplateColumns: `1fr`,
        gridGap: 4,
        marginBottom: 3,
        listStyle: `none`,
        padding: 0,
    }}
>
```

The problem ended up being the "gridGap".
After changing it to "gap", all was well again.

Writing about "love errors" and one of the points I want to make is you can use sourcemaps to figure out where the error happened.
The place I'm interested in is line 90401, but in the source code instead of the built code
Guess another point is scroll up, stacktraces are useful to find out how the code got to the place that produced the error, but in the vast majority of cases you're interested in the top line(s)

```js hl=8 title=BlockQuote.js
footer: {
    fontSize: 1,
    fontWeight: "bold",
    fontStyle: "normal",
    "::before": {
    // make sure mdash is on same line as footer
    float: "left",
    content: "'\\02014\\000A0' ",
    },
},
```
