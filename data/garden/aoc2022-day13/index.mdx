## Day 13: Distress Signal

https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/13

<Aside>
TL;DR: [my solution in Rust](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/scrapyard/blob/main/advent_of_code/2022/src/day_13.rs)
</Aside>

You communication device is receiving a signal, it's a distress signal!

It receives pairs of packets, and some of those pairs are out of order (because of course they are, it wouldn't be a puzzle if everything was hunky dory now would it?).

You need to be able to identify when a pair is ordered wrong so you can swap the packets.

Today's input are the pairs of packets you receive.

An example input looks like this:

```txt title=input.txt
[1,1,3,1,1]
[1,1,5,1,1]

[[1],[2,3,4]]
[[1],4]

[9]
[[8,7,6]]

[[4,4],4,4]
[[4,4],4,4,4]

[7,7,7,7]
[7,7,7]

[]
[3]

[[[]]]
[[]]

[1,[2,[3,[4,[5,6,7]]]],8,9]
[1,[2,[3,[4,[5,6,0]]]],8,9]
```

Each pair is seperated by an empty line.
A packet is that array looking thing on a single line.
And [they look familiar](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/18).

A packet consists of lists and integers.

- A list starts with `[` and ends with `]`.
- A list can be empty
- Each item in a list is seperated by a `,`

The two packets in a pair are called **left** and **right**.

A pair where the left packet is **smaller** than the right packet is in the correct order.

To determine which of two packets is smaller, there are a few rules:

- If both values are integers, the lower integer is smaller.
    - If both integers are identical, continue to the next part of the package.
- If both values are lists, compare each value in the 2 lists step by step.
    - If the left list runs out of values to compare first, it is smaller.
    - If the right list runs out of values to compare first, it is smaller.
- If one value is an integer and the other a list, turn the integer into a list of one integer, and run the comparison again.

## Parsing

I parsed the input into a list of pairs.
Each item in a pair is a packet, so I used a `Packet` data structure.

```rust
enum Packet {
    Num(u8),
    List(Vec<Packet>),
}
```

The main `parse` function splits the input in a double newline.
Parses the 2 packets seperatly, and return a list of those pairs.

```rust title=day_13.rs
fn parse() -> Vec<[Packet; 2]> {
    let input = std::fs::read_to_string("src/day13.txt").unwrap();

    input
        .split("\n\n")
        .map(|pair| {
            let mut lines = pair.lines();
            let left = lines.next().unwrap();
            let right = lines.next().unwrap();

            [parse_packet(left), parse_packet(right)]
        })
        .collect()
}
```

> Yeah, yeah, ... show us `parse_packet`!

Now. If you wanted to be cheeky, every packet is valid [JSON](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).
So you could use your favourite way to parse JSON and call it a victory.

I didn't.

`parse_packet` takes a string, and returns a `Packet`.

```rust
fn parse_packet(s: &str) -> Packet {
    let chars: Vec<_> = s.chars().collect();
    // parse_list returns the first parsed packet and the rest of the input
    // the rest of the input will be empty when it is done
    let (packet, _) = parse_list(&chars);
    packet
}
```

It uses the `parse_list` function, what's that?

It's one of 2 other helper functions.
A packet is either a `Num(u8)` or a `Packet(Vec<Packet>)`.

- The number variant gets parsed by `parse_num`.
- The list variant gets parsed by `parse_num`.

They both use the same pattern.
It consumes a part of what is passed in, and returns the thing it parsed, and the remaining input after that thing.

- for `parse_num` it returns `(Packet::Num(u8), &[char])`
- for `parse_list` it returns `(Packet::List(Vec<Packet>, &[char])`

Where that `&[char]` bit is the remaining input.

At the very top, when we first call `parse_list` in `parse_packet`.
We call `parse_list` on an entire packet, the remaining part will be empty.
That's why I throw it away with that `_`.

<Aside variant="info">
This is a popular pattern.
An example of this pattern implemented in a much more robust and universal way is the [`nom` crate](https://docs.rs/nom/7.1.1/nom/)
</Aside>

```rust
fn parse_num(list: &[char]) -> (Packet, &[char]) {
    // find the index where the first number ends
    let mut i = 0;
    while i < list.len() && list[i].is_ascii_digit() {
        i += 1;
    }

    // parse the number
    // uses math to concatenate numbers instead of turning them into a string first to parse that
    let mut num = 0;
    let mut offset = 1;
    for c in list[..i].iter().rev() {
        num += (*c as u8 - b'0') * offset;
        offset *= 10;
    }

    // return the number and the rest of the packet
    (Packet::Num(num), &list[i..])
}

fn parse_list(list: &[char]) -> (Packet, &[char]) {
    // start by removing the starting [ of the passed in list
    // at the end of this function, we remove the ending ] of the passed in list
    let mut list = &list[1..];
    let mut packets = Vec::new();

    loop {
        match list[0] {
            // list ended, break the loop
            ']' => break,
            // skip over ,
            ',' => list = &list[1..],
            // beginning of new list, time for recursion to parse the inner list
            '[' => {
                let (packet, rest) = parse_list(list);
                packets.push(packet);
                list = rest;
            }
            // beginning of a number
            _ => {
                let (n, rest) = parse_num(list);
                packets.push(n);
                list = rest;
            }
        }
    }

    // return the parsed list and the remaining characters minus the ] that terminates the list this function just parsed
    (Packet::List(packets), &list[1..])
}
```

## Part 1

The question asks what the sum of the indices of the pairs that arrived correctly is.

<Aside variant="danger">
It's one of those days again where Advent of Code insist indices start at 1.
</Aside>

in pseudocode:

```rust title=pseudocode.rs
pairs
    .iter()
    .positions(|[left, right]| left < right)
    .map(|idx| idx + 1)
    .sum()
```

It's that comparison where the next bit of interesting code happens.

I wanted to tell my code how it can compare two `Packet`s.
Make it understand what a less than operation means.

The rules for such a comparison are described in the intro.

### Helpers

To make that comparison possible, I implemented [the `Ord` trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html) in Rust.

Basically, I wrote the code that Rust uses when you do a comparison.

Turns out that you can not only compare 2 numbers, but you can compare 2 lists!
And the logic it uses happens to be the same one described in the problem statement.
That's convenient!

I take the inner "thing" out of a `Packet`, and call them `a` and `b`.
Both are either a `u8`, or a `Vec`.

`a.cmp(b)`, and if only one of them is a vec, wrap the other in a vec and compare that instead!

```rust
#[derive(PartialEq, Eq)]
enum Packet {
    Num(u8),
    List(Vec<Packet>),
}

impl Ord for Packet {
    fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> std::cmp::Ordering {
        match (self, other) {
            (Self::List(a), Self::List(b)) => a.cmp(b),
            (Self::List(a), Self::Num(b)) => a.cmp(&vec![Self::Num(*b)]),
            (Self::Num(a), Self::List(b)) => vec![Self::Num(*a)].cmp(&b),
            (Self::Num(a), Self::Num(b)) => a.cmp(b),
        }
    }
}

impl PartialOrd for Packet {
    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<Ordering> {
        Some(self.cmp(other))
    }
}
```

With this trait implemented, that skeleton code from earlier works.

### Final code

```rust title=day_13.rs
use itertools::Itertools;

pub fn part_1() -> usize {
    let pairs = parse();

    pairs
        .iter()
        .positions(|[left, right]| left < right)
        .map(|idx| idx + 1)
        .sum()
}
```

## Part 2

We need to put all packets in the correct order now.
Ignoring the empty lines.

Two **divider packets** are inserted too.

```txt
[[2]]
[[6]]
```

The question asks what the **decoder key** is.

The **decoder key** is the product of the indices of those 2 divider packets when all packets are in the correct order.

I reused the parsing logic for pairs.
Since we only care about individual packages, I turned the list of pair into a single list with `flatten`.

I parsed those 2 divider packets and inserted them into the list of packets.

Then, sort all packets and search for the divider packets.

The product of their indices (reminder: 1 based indices!) is the answer to part2!

### Final code

```rust title=day_13.rs
use itertools::Itertools;

pub fn part_2() -> usize {
    let pairs = parse();
    let mut packets: Vec<_> = pairs.iter().flatten().collect();

    let divider_1 = parse_packet("[[2]]");
    let divider_2 = parse_packet("[[6]]");

    packets.push(&divider_1);
    packets.push(&divider_2);

    packets.sort_unstable();

    packets
        .into_iter()
        .positions(|packet| packet == &divider_1 || packet == &divider_2)
        .map(|idx| idx + 1)
        .product()
}
```

## Final code
