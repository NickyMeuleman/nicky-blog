To declare a variable in Rust, use the `let` keyword.

```rust
let num = 5;
```

By default, variables are immutable, you can't change them.
If you wish to mutate it, you have to explicitly state that by adding `mut` to that declaration.

```rust
let mut num = 5;
```

Now, the number stored in the variable named `num` may now be changed.

```rust
num = 6;
```

Another piece of data that's immutable, (so can't change) is a constant.
Declared with the `const` keyword.

You might already be familiar with this concept, and wonder:

- You aren't allowed to use `mut` on constants. No mutating, ever.

- The type of a constant _must_ be declared, whereas the type of a variable _may_ be declared.

- Constants can only be set to a constant [expression](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-03-how-functions-work.html?highlight=expression#function-bodies-contain-statements-and-expressions), not to the result of a function call or anything that could only be determined at runtime.

As a result, constants are always fixed in size, and known at compile time.  
Another, less obvious result, is that constants may not be of a type that requires [allocation on the heap](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html?highlight=heap#the-stack-and-the-heap), since they're not known at compile time.

- The naming convention for `const` is `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
- The naming convention for `let` is `snake_case`.

```rust
const SPEED_OF_LIGHT: u32 = 299792458;
```

Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope.  
They are valid for the entire runtime of the program inside that scope.  
Translation: You can put constants outside of the `main` function and it will work.

More on expressions and the heap in later blogposts. If you see this and I
haven't written about it yet, feel free to mention it on
