TL;DR:

- `if let` is a fancy `if` condition.
- `while let` is a fancy `while` loop.

They enter a codeblock if a destructuring assignment works.

</Aside>


With the `if let` syntax you combine an `if` condition with a destructuring `let` assignment.

Let's unpack (pun intended) that sentence.

## The `if` condition

```rust
let my_pick: Option<u8> = Some(3);
if Some(3) == my_pick {
    println!("Honeybadger don't care.");
}
```

This line prints, alerting everyone that `Some(3)` is equal to `my_pick`, and more importantly that [honeybadgers don't care](https://youtu.be/4r7wHMg5Yjg).

## Destructuring assignments

If array destructuring works with square brackets, and tuple destructuring works via parentheses, it makes sense an `Option` could be destructured via `Some`.

<Aside variant="info">


A quick recap for array and tuple destructuring:

```rust
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
let [one, two, three] = arr;
println!("Counting: {}, {}, {}", one, two, three);
// Counting: 1, 2, 3

let tup = ("Daniel", "Ricciardo", 3);
let (first_name, last_name, racing_number) = tup;
println!("{} {} races with the number: {}", first_name, last_name, racing_number);
// Daniel Ricciardo races with the number: 3
```

</Aside>


If you try to destructure what's inside `my_pick` to the `number` variable with `Some(number)`, Rust will not compile and show a warning:

```rust
let my_pick: Option<u8> = Some(3);
let Some(number) = my_pick;
println!("Daniel Ricciardo, nicknamed 'the honeybadger' races with the number: {}", number);
// error
```

```error
error[E0005]: refutable pattern in local binding: `None` not covered
```

Because `my_pick` has the type of `Option<u8>`, it will either be a `Some(<u8>)` or a `None`.
The piece of code above assumes there will always be some integer inside and neglects the possibility `my_pick` is `None`.

The Rust compiler won't let you do that, it requires every possibile value for the `Option` to be covered!

In this contrived example, humans can see `my_pick` will always be `Some(3)`, but the compiler can't.

We can use a `match` to cover every possibility.

```rust
let my_pick: Option<u8> = Some(3);
let number = match my_pick {
    Some(num) => num,
    None => panic!("Oh no, no number!")
};
println!("Daniel Ricciardo, nicknamed 'the honeybadger' races with the number: {}", number);
```

<Aside variant="info">


We could have also been even more specific and only execute the `println!` if the number inside the `Option` was 3, while ignoring any other possibility.

```rust
let my_pick: Option<u8> = Some(3);
let number = match my_pick {
    Some(3) => 3,
    _ => panic!("Oh no, no number!")
};
println!("Daniel Ricciardo, nicknamed 'the honeybadger' races with the number: {}", number);
```

</Aside>


That's a bit verbose, we don't care about the `None` case and only want to do something if `my_pick` holds a `Some`.

Even worse, the way this code is written, it depends on a `Some` being there, else it will `panic`.
What we really want is to conditionally print that line.
If `my_pick` is a `Some`: print it, if it is `None`: ignore that `println` and continue with the program.

## Combining an if condition with a destructuring attempt

Combining that destructuring attempt with an `if` condition gives us the `if let` syntax.

It tries to destructure, if that destructure works, the attached codeblock is entered.
If it doesn't work, the codeblock isn't entered and the code continues.

```rust
let my_pick: Option<u8> = Some(3);
if let Some(number) = my_pick {
    println!("Daniel Ricciardo, nicknamed 'the honeybadger' races with the number: {}", number);
}
```

In the case we only care about `my_pick` holding a `Some(3)`:

```rust
let my_pick: Option<u8> = Some(3);
if let Some(3) = my_pick {
    println!("Daniel Ricciardo, nicknamed 'the honeybadger' races with the number: 3");
}
```

</Aside>


### The `else` case

As you would expect from an `if` condition, it can be combined with `else if` and `else`.
The `else if` condition can also be a conditional destructuring attempt with `else if let`.

```rust
let my_pick: Option<u8> = Some(33);
if let Some(3) = my_pick {
    println!("Daniel Ricciardo, nicknamed 'the honeybadger' races with the number: 3");
} else if let Some(33) = my_pick {
  println!("Max, Max, Max, super Max, Max");
} else {
  println!("Unknown driver");
}
```

Here, `my_pick` is `Some(33)`.
The `if` doesn't succeed anymore, the `else if` condition succeeds, printing a lyric from a [Max Verstappen fansong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43HCYSXZ9GI).

If `my_pick` held yet another `Some` or if it held `None`, the `else` block would execute.

## Do it again, and again

The `while let` syntax does almost the same thing.
Instead of continuing on when the end of the conditional codeblock is reached, it checks the condition again.
If the destructuring that is attempted there works again, enter the codeblock again! Rinse, repeat.

The `pop` method on a vector returns an `Option`.
The code below uses `while let` to print out the number if `pop` returns a `Some` with that number.
In the case where `pop` returns `None`, the codeblock will not be entered again and the loop stops.

```rust
let mut my_picks: Vec<u8> = vec![3, 33, 44];
while let Some(num) = my_picks.pop() {
    println!("{}", num);
}
```

<Aside variant="danger">


Like the regular `while` loop,
`while let` does not have an `else if` or an `else` case.

</Aside>


## Not limited to the `Option` type

The `if let` and `while let` doesn't always need to try and destructure an `Option`.

The following piece of code tries to destructure an `Ok(3)` from a `Result`.

```rust
let my_pick: Result<u8, ()> = Ok(3);
if let Ok(3) = my_pick {
    println!("Daniel Ricciardo, nicknamed 'the honeybadger' races with the number: 3");
}
```

The thing we try to destructure doesn't have to be the kind of enum variant that holds something, simple enums variants work too!

```rust
enum SesameStreetChar {
    Count,
    // others
}
let best_vampire = SesameStreetChar::Count;
if let SesameStreetChar::Count = best_vampire {
  println!("Ah, ah, ah!");
};
```

<Aside variant="info">


In the previous example, a straight comparison would fail because the enum doesn't implement the [`PartialEq` trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialEq.html).

```rust
if SesameStreetChar::Count == best_vampire {
  println!("this does not compile");
}
// error
```

`if let` still works.

```rust
if let SesameStreetChar::Count = best_vampire {
  println!("boo!");
}
```
