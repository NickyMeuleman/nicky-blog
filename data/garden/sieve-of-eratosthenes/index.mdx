The [sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) finds all [prime numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) up to a given limit.

## Method

The algorithm starts out by assuming all numbers are prime, and marking them as such.
At the end of the algorithm, only prime numbers up to an upper limit will still be marked.

The number 1 is a special case, so we start off by unmarking it.

Then we go through the numbers one by one.
For every non-prime number we find, skip to the next number.

If a number is still marked as prime, it is.  
Before moving on to the next number, we first unmark every multiple of the found prime.

Those multiples can be divided through the prime number we just found, so by definition isn't prime.

We repeat this process until we reach the upper limit.
Every number that is still marked as prime is.

## Optimizations

### Square root

<Aside>

TL;DR: Only check numbers up to the square root of the upper limit.
After that, every number up to that limit will be accurately marked, because math is cool.

</Aside>

While iterating through all numbers, when we hit the square root of that upper limit,
every number up to that limit will be accurately marked.
It's unnecessary to continue.

Any non-prime number can be expressed as the product of 2 numbers that are not 1 or itself.

$$
n = a * b
$$

$a$ and $b$ are _factors_ or $n$.

Because $n = \sqrt{n} * \sqrt{n}$, we can state that one number is less than or equal to and the other is greater than or equal to $\sqrt{n}$.

$$
a \leq \sqrt{n}
\newline
b \geq \sqrt{n}
$$

If you unmark multiples of all numbers less than or equal to $\sqrt{n}$, then all numbers greater than $\sqrt{n}$ will also be unmarked.

Every number that is less than or equal to $n$ and is a multiple of a number greater than $\sqrt{n}$ will have a factor that is less than or equal to $\sqrt{n}$ and will already be unmarked.

As a result, all the non-primes $\geq \sqrt{n}$ will be unmarked in the process of checking every number $\leq \sqrt{n}$.

An **example** by taking the sentence above and plugging in numbers:

Every number that is less than or equal to $21$ and is a multiple of a number greater than $\sqrt{21} = 4.58$ will have a factor that is less than or equal to $\sqrt{21} = 4.58$.

$18$ is less than $21$ and is greater than $4.58$.
That sentence states it will have a factor that is less than $4.58$, and it does!

$3$ is a factor.
Because $3$ is a factor of $18$, it will already have been unmarked during the part where we unmark every multiple in a previous iteration of the algorithm!

### Start unmarking at the square

During the step the algorithm unmarks all multiples of a number.
We can start unmarking at that number squared.

Every multiple below it will already be unmarked in a previous iteration.

## Step by step in code

The goal is to write a function that returns a list of prime numbers, up to `upper_bound`.

<Aside>

I named that variable `optimus_prime` while writing code for this post, because I thought that was funny

</Aside>

We initialise a list of booleans that is one bigger than the given `upper_bound` and call it `sieve`.
These booleans tell us if the number at that index is prime or not. (`True` for prime, `False` for not)

```python title=sieve.py hl=3
def primes_up_to(upper_bound):
  # initialise sieve that marks all numbers as prime
  sieve = [True] * (upper_bound + 1)
```

Smart people decided programmers start counting at 0, so that's why that list is 1 bigger than `upper_bound`.
It's also the reason why we have to unmark the index 0 along with the index 1 before we start our loop.

```python title=sieve.py hl=6-7
def primes_up_to(upper_bound):
  # initialise sieve that marks all numbers as prime
  sieve = [True] * (upper_bound + 1)

  # 0 and 1 are not prime
  sieve[0] = False
  sieve[1] = False
```

This works out perfectly, because now every index exactly matches the number it represents.

You want to know if the number 69 is prime? The boolean at index 69 will tell you.

Loop over every number, starting at 2 and [ending at the square root of `upper_bound`](#square-root).
Inside the loop, index `sieve` with that number.

```python title=sieve.py hl=15-17
import math

def primes_up_to(upper_bound):
  # initialise sieve that marks all numbers as prime
  sieve = [True] * (upper_bound + 1)

  # 0 and 1 are not prime
  sieve[0] = False
  sieve[1] = False

  # iterate up to square root of upper_bound
  # reason: if num is not prime and one factor of num is bigger than sqrt(upper_bound),
  # an other factor _must_ be smaller than sqrt(upper_bound)
  # detecting one factor is enough to say a number is not prime
  for num in range(2, math.floor(math.sqrt(upper_bound)) + 1):
    # if sieve[num] is true, then num is prime
    if sieve[num]:
```

If the boolean at that location is `True`, the number is prime and we unmark every multiple before moving on to the next step of our loop.

Do this by skip counting, [starting at the number squared](#start-unmarking-at-the-square) and adding the number every time until you hit `upper_bound`.  
For every encountered multiple, set `sieve` at the index to `False`.

```python title=sieve.py hl=21-22
import math

def primes_up_to(upper_bound):
  # initialise sieve that marks all numbers as prime
  sieve = [True] * (upper_bound + 1)

  # 0 and 1 are not prime
  sieve[0] = False
  sieve[1] = False

  # iterate up to square root of upper_bound
  # reason: if num is not prime and one factor of num is bigger than sqrt(upper_bound),
  # an other factor _must_ be smaller than sqrt(upper_bound)
  # detecting one factor is enough to say a number is not prime
  for num in range(2, math.floor(math.sqrt(upper_bound)) + 1):
    # if sieve[num] is true, then num is prime
    if sieve[num]:
      # unmark all multiples
      # start marking at num squared
      # every num below has already been marked in previous iterations
      for multiple in range(num ** 2, upper_bound + 1, num):
        sieve[multiple] = False
```

At the end of that loop, `sieve` will be full of booleans corresponding to the primeness of every possible index to that list.
Use your favourite method to loop over a list while also getting the index, and put the indexes with a `true` into a new list, and presto, primes.

```python title=sieve.py hl=25
import math

def primes_up_to(upper_bound):
  # initialise sieve that marks all numbers as prime
  sieve = [True] * (upper_bound + 1)

  # 0 and 1 are not prime
  sieve[0] = False
  sieve[1] = False

  # iterate up to square root of upper_bound
  # reason: if num is not prime and one factor of num is bigger than sqrt(upper_bound),
  # an other factor _must_ be smaller than sqrt(upper_bound)
  # detecting one factor is enough to say a number is not prime
  for num in range(2, math.floor(math.sqrt(upper_bound)) + 1):
    # if sieve[num] is true, then num is prime
    if sieve[num]:
      # unmark all multiples
      # start marking at num squared
      # every num below has already been marked in previous iterations
      for multiple in range(num ** 2, upper_bound + 1, num):
        sieve[multiple] = False

  # sieve is done, turn `True` into numbers
  return [idx for idx, mark in enumerate(sieve) if mark]
```

<Aside variant="success">

The returned value is a list of prime numbers, starting at 2, and ending in the last prime up to `upper_bound`.

- `primes_up_to(16)` returns `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]`.
- `primes_up_to(17)` returns `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]`.
- `primes_up_to(18)` returns `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]`.
- `primes_up_to(19)` returns `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]`.
