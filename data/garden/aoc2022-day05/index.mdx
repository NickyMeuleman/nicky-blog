## Day 5: Supply Stacks

https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5

<Aside>
  TL;DR: [my solution in
  Rust](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/scrapyard/blob/main/advent_of_code/2022/src/day_05.rs)
</Aside>

Today, the elves have to reoganize the crates in the ship's cargo hold.

Each crate has a letter to identify it.

Your input has the starting positions of the stacks, and a list of move instructions.

An example input looks like this:

```txt
// input.txt
    [D]    
[N] [C]    
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3 

move 1 from 2 to 1
move 3 from 1 to 3
move 2 from 2 to 1
move 1 from 1 to 2
```

In this example there are 3 platforms.

- The stack on platform 1, from bottom to the top has crates: `Z`, and `N`.
- The stack on platform 2, from bottom to the top has crates: `M`, `C`, and `D`.
- The stack on platform 3, from bottom to the top has crates: `P`.

In each move instruction, an amount of crates is moved from one platform to another.

## Implementation

I started by parsing that input into useful data structures.

This is how I want to represent that input in Rust:
- Each crate is identified by a letter: a `char`.
- Each platform has a stack of crates: a `Vec<char>`.
- There are multiple stacks: a `Vec<Vec<char>>`.

Desired result: the starting positions of the stacks in the input is parsed as a `Vec<Vec<char>>`.

Each instruction has 3 parts:
- an amount of crates to be moved
- the number of a platform's stack to take the crates **from**
- the number of a platform's stack to move to crates **to**

So I created a `struct` with those fields.

```rust
struct Instruction {
    amount: usize,
    from: usize,
    to: usize,
}
```

Desired result: the list of instructions in the input is parsed as a `Vec<Instruction>`.

## Parsing the input

<Aside variant="info">
Those questionmarks in my code, I affectionately refer to those as the Annie operator.

[Read the blogpost about what they do, and why I call it the Annie operator](/garden/rust-syntax-questionmark)
</Aside>

Split the entire input file on two newlines.
The first part is the starting positions, and the second part is the move instructions.

I took the last line off the starting positions, that's the line with the platform numbers.

I figure out how many stacks there are by finding the last platform number and create that many empty vectors.

```rust
let (left, instructions_str) = input.split_once("\n\n").unwrap();
let (stacks_str, platforms) = left.rsplit_once('\n').unwrap();
let num_stacks = platforms.split_whitespace().last().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
let mut stacks = vec![Vec::new(); num_stacks];
```

### Starting positions

I loop through the lines of the starting positions in reverse.
Whenever I find a crate (a letter) I push it into the corresponding stack.

Each crate is represented by `[X]`, where `X` is a different letter.

Each stack is seperated by a space.

If there is no crate in a line, the space where one would be has three spaces instead of the `[X]`.

So for every line in that loop, I look at chunks of 4 (3 for the potential crate + 1 in between).

If the second item in that chunk is a letter, it's the letter for a crate.  
I push it into stack with that chunk's index.

```rust
use itertools::Itertools;

for line in stacks_str.lines().rev() {
    for (idx, mut chunk) in line.chars().chunks(4).into_iter().enumerate() {
        let second = chunk.nth(1)?;
        if second.is_alphabetic() {
            stacks[idx].push(second);
        }
    }
}
```

### Move instructions

Parsing the list of instructions into a `Vec<Instruction>` is more straightforward.

Each instruction has the exact same structure.
I split on some words that appear in each one, and convert that line to an `Instruction`.

```rust
let mut instructions = Vec::new();
for line in instructions_str.lines() {
    let rest = line.strip_prefix("move ")?;
    let (amount, rest) = rest.split_once(" from ")?;
    let (from, to) = rest.split_once(" to ")?;
    let instruction = Instruction {
        amount: amount.parse().ok()?,
        from: from.parse::<usize>().ok()? - 1,
        to: to.parse::<usize>().ok()? - 1,
    };
    instructions.push(instruction);
}
```

### Final code

```rust title=day_05.rs
fn parse_input() -> Option<(Vec<Vec<char>>, Vec<Instruction>)> {
    let input = std::fs::read_to_string("src/day05.txt").ok()?;
    let (left, instructions_str) = input.split_once("\n\n")?;
    let (stacks_str, platforms) = left.rsplit_once('\n')?;

    // parse crates
    let num_stacks = platforms.split_whitespace().last()?.parse().ok()?;
    let mut stacks = vec![Vec::new(); num_stacks];

    for line in stacks_str.lines().rev() {
        for (idx, mut chunk) in line.chars().chunks(4).into_iter().enumerate() {
            let second = chunk.nth(1)?;
            if second.is_alphabetic() {
                stacks[idx].push(second);
            }
        }
    }

    // parse instructions
    let mut instructions = Vec::new();
    for line in instructions_str.lines() {
        let rest = line.strip_prefix("move ")?;
        let (amount, rest) = rest.split_once(" from ")?;
        let (from, to) = rest.split_once(" to ")?;
        let instruction = Instruction {
            amount: amount.parse().ok()?,
            from: from.parse::<usize>().ok()? - 1,
            to: to.parse::<usize>().ok()? - 1,
        };
        instructions.push(instruction);
    }

    Some((stacks, instructions))
}
```

## Part 1

The move instructions are performed by a crane that can move **one crate at a time**.

If the instruction says to move 3 crates from stack 1 to stack 3, it does 3 seperate moves of a single crate.

The question asks to find which crates end up on top of each stack after all instructions are done.

To do that, I loop through the instructions to perform them.

For each instruction I loop `amount` times.
`pop()`ing a crate off the top of the `from` stack, and `push()`ing that crate to the top of the `to` stack.

At the end, I take the top crate in each stack, and add those `char`s together into a `String`.

[I wrote a blogpost about the `if let` syntax.](https://nickymeuleman.netlify.app/garden/rust-if-let-while-let)
</Aside>

```rust title=day_05.rs
pub fn part_1() -> String {
    let (mut stacks, instructions) = parse_input().unwrap();
    for Instruction { amount, from, to } in instructions {
        for _ in 0..amount {
            if let Some(removed) = stacks[from].pop() {
                stacks[to].push(removed);
            }
        }
    }

    stacks
        .iter()
        .filter_map(|stack| stack.iter().last())
        .collect()
}
```

## Part 2

The crane turns out to be a newer model that **move multiple crates at once**.

The question asks to find which crates end up on top of each stack after all instructions are done again.

To do that, I loop through the instructions to perform them.

For each instruction I remove `amount` crates from the `from` stack, and add them to the `to` stack.
Rust has [a handy method to do that called `split_off`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.split_off).

At the end, I take the top crate in each stack, and add those `char`s together into a `String`.

```rust title=day_05.rs
pub fn part_2() -> String {
    let (mut stacks, instructions) = parse_input().unwrap();
    for Instruction { amount, from, to } in instructions {
        let from_stack_len = stacks[from].len();
        let removed = stacks[from].split_off(from_stack_len - amount);
        stacks[to].extend(removed);
    }

    stacks
        .iter()
        .filter_map(|stack| stack.iter().last())
        .collect()
}
```

    let (stacks_str, platforms) = left.rsplit_once('\n')?;

    // parse crates
    let num_stacks = platforms.split_whitespace().last()?.parse().ok()?;
    let mut stacks = vec![Vec::new(); num_stacks];

        for (idx, mut chunk) in line.chars().chunks(4).into_iter().enumerate() {
            let second = chunk.nth(1)?;
            if second.is_alphabetic() {
                stacks[idx].push(second);
