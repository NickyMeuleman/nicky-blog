<Aside>

TL;DR: Expressions evaluate to a value, they return that value.
Statements do not.

</Aside>

Statements are instructions that _do_ something, they don't return a value.
Expressions _evaluate to a value_, they return that value.

Assigning a value to a variable is a statement, it doesn't return anything.

```rust
let num = 5;
```

Expressions can be part of a statement.

While the line above is a statement, it contains an expression (something that evaluates to a value).
In this case, the value itself, the integer `5`.

<Aside variant="danger">

Variable assignment being a statement is the reason you can't assign a value to the result of another assignment.
You can in many other languages, not in Rust.

The following snippet would try to assign "nothing" to the `also_num` variable, that's an error!

```rust
let also_num = (let num = 5); // error!
```

</Aside>

<Aside variant="info">

Statements technically return something. Rust's way to express "nothing here", the empty tuple `()`.

Function bodies are made up of a series of statements, optionally ending in an expression.

Expressions do not include ending semicolons.
If you add a semicolon to the end of an expression, you turn it into a statement, which will then not return a value.

If a function ends in an expression, it returns the value of that expression.

A function definition is a statement, it does not result in a value.
Calling a function is an expression, that expression evaluates to whatever that function call returns.

```rust
let num = add(4, 1);

fn add(x: i32, y:i32) -> i32 {
    x + y
}
```

The lines where the `add` function is defined, are a statement, those lines don't evaluate to anything.  
Calling `add(4, 1)` is an expression, it evaluates to a value (the integer `5`).  
Inside the function, the last line of the function body is an expression `x + y`.  
That ending expression evaluates to a value and the function returns it.

<Aside variant="danger">

If that line ended in a semicolon instead (ie. `x + y;`), it would turn the expression into a statement.
That would not return a value, causing the function to not return a value.

That would mean we lied when we defined the function, as we stated it would return an integer of type `i32` (with the syntax `-> i32`).
The function doesn't do that anymore.
It returns nothing now.

This is a bug and the Rust compiler won't let you do this.

</Aside>

The value `add(4, 1)` evaluated to is then assigned to the variable named `num`.
That entire line (ie. `let num = add(4, 1);`) is a statement.

A codeblock that creates a new scope (ie. `{}`) is an expression (it evaluates to a value).

```rust
let num = {
    let x = 4;
    x + 1
};
```

Inside that codeblock, a variable declaration statement happens, followed by an expression (`x + 1`).
The value that last expression evaluates to will be the value the entire codeblock evaluates to.
That value is then assigned to the `num` variable in this example.

You may explicitly return a value from a function by using the `return` keyword followed by an expression.  
By convention, that line is terminated with a semicolon.
As you might expect, that isn't mandatory and the compiler won't complain if you leave it off.

This is an `add` function that explicitly ends execution and returns a value is equivalent to the `add` above that ended with an expression.

```rust
fn add(x: i32, y:i32) -> i32 {
    return x + y;
}
```

---

We can use this mechanism to make code that has a variable declaration that is only used to later be populated a bit shorter.

```rust title=example.rs
fn main() {
    let num = 5;
    let mut name = "";
    if num > 3 {
        name = "Tom";
    } else {
        name = "Jerry";
    }
    println!("{}", name);
}
```

`if` is an expression, it returns a value.

The value an `if` evaluates to is the value of the codeblock it executed.
That means we can rewrite our example above.

Now, `name` is never an empty string, it's either `"Tom"` or `"Jerry"`.

```rust title=example.rs
fn main() {
    let num = 5;
    let name = if num > 3 {
        "Tom"
    } else {
        "Jerry"
    };
    println!("{}", name);
}
```

This means that every arm of the `if` statement must return the same type.
If we return different types from the branches, the compiler won't be able to figure out what the resulting type of the entire `if` is and will show a compilation error.

A similar approach can be taken with more programming constructs in Rust that are expressions: like `match`.
