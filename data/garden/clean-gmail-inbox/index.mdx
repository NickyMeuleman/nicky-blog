I've had my Gmail email address for years.
A lot of time went by where I didn't pay much attention to it. This led to well over 20.000 emails sitting in my inbox.
Read, mind you.

They might have all been "read", however.
I've been clicking the "mark as read" button without actually reading emails for months.

So, I decided to clean up all the emails that were currectly sitting in my inbox.
Either by deleting them, or archiving them.

I would archive every email that was still valuable today, while deleting the ones that were merely taking up space.

That distinction is quite subjective and will vary for everyone. The sentiment was: archive receipts and send old pricing catalogues to [the shadow realm](https://yugioh.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Realm).

No third party tools were used to do this, only the gmail webapp, and lots, _lots_ of time.

The eventual goal is that **every email in my inbox brings value**.

## Preparation

I'm about to deal with _a lot_ of emails.
I wanted to display as much information as possible on a single screen.

To the settings! To set the display density to compact and the amount of emails per page to 100.

## Get that number down

Getting from an overloaded inbox to an empty one is no small task, but certainly doable.
This doesn't need to happen all at once, I did it over the span of 4 weeks. Chipping away at that huge number every time I checked my email.

Because Gmail's standard sorting if fairly good, I left the standard [tabs at the top](https://lifehacker.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-gmails-new-super-co-511765933) of the inbox.

<Aside>

I definitely only left the standard tabs because the sorting is good. Not because I was lazy when it came to email, nuh-uh.

</Aside>

This often resulted in selecting all 100 mails on the current page of the promotions tab, followed by the delete button.
With the other tabs (social, updates, and forums) it went slightly slower. With a bit more emails being unchecked, and archived instead.

Around the 5.000 emails left point is when I switched strategies.

I identified senders that sent me a lot of email and started searching for those emails using [Search operators](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en).
This made it less of a chore to decide to archive or delete individual ones. I could often fall back on the trusted "select all and delete everything" tactic, cathartic.

An example of one of those filters would be `from:github in:inbox`. That would list all emails I got from GitHub that weren't already archived or deleted.

As time went on and that number decreased, those searches resulted in less and less results.

## Slow the stream

All that work would be for nothing if emails continued to pour in at the same speed.

**Unsubscribe**, that's the number one method to reduce the amount of incoming emails.
Do it often and without guilt.

Again, it's a value judgement about wheter or not you would like to continue receiving emails from an email list.
I found that I hit the unsubscribe link more often than not.

Gmail surfaces an unscubscribe link at the top of an opened email, making unsubscribing easy.
Sometimes, it won't be there, so look for it inside the email.
More often than not, it's at the bottom of the email in a tiny fontsize and a color that barely contrasts with the background.

It turns out I unsubscribed from more list that go out of their way to hide the unsubscribe link than the ones that surface it clearly.

### Filters

_But email list sometimes have sweet deals._

True, some list cross the line from noise to signal. Most of them only sometimes.

That doesn't mean blanket unsubscribing from every email list.
