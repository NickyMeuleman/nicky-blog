## Day 22: Sand Slabs

https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/22

<Aside>
TL;DR: [my solution in Rust](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/scrapyard/blob/main/advent_of_code/2023/solutions/src/day_22.rs)
</Aside>

The sand is falling in compacted bricks.
They are stacking on top of each other!

Today's input is a snapshot of the bricks while they were still falling.

An example input looks like this:
```txt title=input.txt
1,0,1~1,2,1
0,0,2~2,0,2
0,2,3~2,2,3
0,0,4~0,2,4
2,0,5~2,2,5
0,1,6~2,1,6
1,1,8~1,1,9
```

Each line of the input represent a single brick.
It is represented by 2 points, one for each end of the brick/stick/whetever you want to call them.

<Aside variant="info">

That means each brick has the shape of a cuboid

</Aside>

The bricks will never rotate, and are very strong (something, something, magic).
Even if only one piece of a brick is supporting all other bricks, the tower will not fall.

The bricks cannot pass through eachother, so a falling brick will come to rest when it encounters a space that is either occupied by an other brick, or the ground.

The ground is located at `z=0`, a higher `z` means the brick is up in the air higher.

## Parsing

The 2 points for a brick are separated by a tilde `~`, and each coordinate within it is separated by a comma `,`.

I used the word coordinate, so I made a `Coord` structure.
One that can handle 3D space this time.
Paired with a method that can turn a string like `"1,2,3"` into a `Coord { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3}`:
```rust
struct Coord {
    x: u16,
    y: u16,
    z: u16,
}

impl Coord {
    fn from(s: &str) -> Self {
        let (x, y, z) = s.split(",").collect_tuple().unwrap();
        Self {
            x: x.parse().unwrap(),
            y: y.parse().unwrap(),
            z: z.parse().unwrap(),
        }
    }
}
```

A `Brick` has 2 `Coord`s, one for `from`, and one for `to`.
```rust
struct Brick {
    from: Coord,
    to: Coord,
}

impl Brick {
    fn from(s: &str) -> Self {
        let (lhs, rhs) = s.split_once("~").unwrap();
        Self {
            from: Coord::from(lhs),
            to: Coord::from(rhs),
        }
    }
}
```

Using that to parse the input into a list of bricks:
```rust
fn parse(input: &str) -> Vec<Brick> {
    input.lines().map(Brick::from).collect()
}
```

## Part 1

First, [let the ~~sky~~ bricks fall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeumyOzKqgI).

The question asks how many bricks can be safely disintegrated.

A brick can be safely disintegrated if removing it causes no other bricks to fall.

The pseudocode I want to work towards:
```rust
let mut bricks = parse(input);

(0..bricks.len())
    .filter(/* keep bricks that disintegrate safely */)
    .count()
```

### Preparation

To let every brick fall, I sorted all bricks by `z` first, then made them fall one by one, starting at the lowest one.

```rust
fn prepare(bricks: &mut Vec<Brick>) {
    // sort bricks by lowest height
    bricks.sort_by_key(|brick| brick.from.z);

    // coord - block_idx
    let mut occupied = HashSet::new();

    for brick in bricks.iter_mut() {
        brick.fall(&occupied);
        for (x, y, z) in iproduct!(
            brick.from.x..=brick.to.x,
            brick.from.y..=brick.to.y,
            brick.from.z..=brick.to.z
        ) {
            let coord = Coord { x, y, z };
            occupied.insert(coord);
        }
    }
}
```
The `occupied` map keeps track of every single `Coord` that is occupied by bricks that have come to rest.
After a `Brick` has fallen, all its coordinates are added to the `occupied` map, and the next `Brick` can start falling.

The `fall` method lets a `Brick` fall as far as possible while respecting the positions that are already occupied.
```rust
impl Brick {
    fn can_fall(&self, occupied: &HashSet<Coord>) -> bool {
        // ground is at z == 0
        let above_ground = self.from.z > 1;
        let blocked = (self.from.x..=self.to.x)
            .cartesian_product(self.from.y..=self.to.y)
            .any(|(x, y)| {
                let pos = Coord {
                    x,
                    y,
                    z: self.from.z - 1,
                };
                occupied.contains(&pos)
            });

        above_ground && !blocked
    }

    fn fall(&mut self, occupied: &HashSet<Coord>) {
        while self.can_fall(occupied) {
            self.from.z -= 1;
            self.to.z -= 1;
        }
    }
}
```

Now that the bricks have fallen, I want to build up some data structure that keeps track of which bricks are supporting/supported by other bricks.

This can be done while letting the bricks fall!

For every brick, I kept track if the index in that sorted list to identify it.
When a brick has fallen, I add every `Coord` the brick occupies to 2 maps.
1. Above map - given the index of a brick, return all bricks it supports
1. Below map - given the index of a brick, return all bricks it is supported by.

To achieve this, some minor changes:
```rust hl=1,7,8,13-28,31
fn prepare(bricks: &mut Vec<Brick>) -> (HashMap<u16, HashSet<u16>>, HashMap<u16, HashSet<u16>>) {
    // sort bricks by lowest height
    bricks.sort_by_key(|brick| brick.from.z);

    // coord - block_idx
    let mut occupied = HashMap::new();
    let mut above_map: HashMap<u16, HashSet<u16>> = HashMap::new();
    let mut below_map: HashMap<u16, HashSet<u16>> = HashMap::new();

    for (idx, brick) in bricks.iter_mut().enumerate() {
        brick.fall(&occupied);

        for (x, y) in (brick.from.x..=brick.to.x).cartesian_product(brick.from.y..=brick.to.y) {
            for z in brick.from.z..=brick.to.z {
                let coord = Coord { x, y, z };
                occupied.insert(coord, idx as u16);
            }
            // check if the coord of a brick below this one (that's why we use the min z, to handle vertical blocks) is occupied
            let below = Coord {
                x,
                y,
                z: brick.from.z - 1,
            };
            if let Some(&below_idx) = occupied.get(&below) {
                above_map.entry(below_idx).or_default().insert(idx as u16);
                below_map.entry(idx as u16).or_default().insert(below_idx);
            }
        }
    }

    (above_map, below_map)
}
```

And to the methods on `Brick`:
```rust hl=2,13,19
impl Brick {
    fn can_fall(&self, occupied: &HashMap<Coord, u16>) -> bool {
        // ground is at z == 0
        let above_ground = self.from.z > 1;
        let blocked = (self.from.x..=self.to.x)
            .cartesian_product(self.from.y..=self.to.y)
            .any(|(x, y)| {
                let pos = Coord {
                    x,
                    y,
                    z: self.from.z - 1,
                };
                occupied.contains_key(&pos)
            });

        above_ground && !blocked
    }

    fn fall(&mut self, occupied: &HashMap<Coord, u16>) {
        while self.can_fall(occupied) {
            self.from.z -= 1;
            self.to.z -= 1;
        }
    }
}
```

### Helpers

Using those 2 maps I can write a helper function to determine if a brick is safe to disintegrate.

The function takes in an id (index in the list of resting bricks) along with those 2 maps.

For every id that gets passed to the function:
1. If no bricks are above it, it is safe to disintegrate.
1. If there are bricks above it, removing it should not cause any of those bricks to fall.

```rust
fn disintegrates_safely(
    id: u16,
    above_map: &HashMap<u16, HashSet<u16>>,
    below_map: &HashMap<u16, HashSet<u16>>,
) -> bool {
    if let Some(above) = above_map.get(&id) {
        // check if the removed block was the only one supporting this upper block
        above
            .iter()
            .all(|idx| below_map.get(idx).unwrap().len() > 1)
    } else {
        // no blocks above, this block is safe to remove
        true
    }
}
```

### Code

```rust title=day_22.rs
pub fn part_1(input: &str) -> usize {
    let mut bricks = parse(input);
    let (above_map, below_map) = prepare(&mut bricks);

    (0..bricks.len())
        .filter(|&id| disintegrates_safely(id as u16, &above_map, &below_map))
        .count()
}
```

## Part 2

It's not fast enough!
We'll have to take risks and set off a chain reaction.

For every individual brick, calculate how many bricks would fall if you remove it.

The question asks what the sum is of all those bricks.

The pseudocode I want to work towards:
```rust
let mut bricks = parse(input);
let (above_map, below_map) = prepare(&mut bricks);

(0..bricks.len())
    .map(/* remove 1 brick and calculate how many other bricks fall */)
    .sum()
```

### Helpers

The parsing and preparating are identical to part1.

A function that takes in the id of a `Brick`, removes it, and recurses with the ids of all `Brick`s that no longer have any `Brick` supporting them:
```rust
fn disintegrate(
    id: u16,
    above_map: &HashMap<u16, HashSet<u16>>,
    below_map: &HashMap<u16, HashSet<u16>>,
    disintegrated: &mut HashSet<u16>,
) {
    disintegrated.insert(id);

    if let Some(above) = above_map.get(&id) {
        for above_idx in above {
            if let Some(below) = below_map.get(above_idx) {
                if below.iter().all(|idx| disintegrated.contains(idx)) {
                    disintegrate(*above_idx, above_map, below_map, disintegrated)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The id of every removed `Brick` is remembered in a set.
So the length of that set - 1 is the amount of every other brick the first brick caused to fall.
(minus 1 because it includes the brick that was originally removed, and the question doesn't ask for that)

### Code

```rust title=day_22.rs
pub fn part_2(input: &str) -> usize {
    let mut bricks = parse(input);
    let (above_map, below_map) = prepare(&mut bricks);

    (0..bricks.len())
        .map(|id| {
            let mut disintegrated = HashSet::new();
            disintegrate(id as u16, &above_map, &below_map, &mut disintegrated);
            disintegrated.len() - 1
        })
        .sum()
}
```
