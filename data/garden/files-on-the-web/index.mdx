Here is where I would put an intro to an article about using files on the web, [IF I HAD ONE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omguEZ7jy5E).

## Getting a `File`

A [`File` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) lets you read a bunch of information about a file, including the contents.

### The `<input type="file" />`

Ol' reliable, the `<input>` element.

Give it a `type` attribute of `"file"`, and a button appears that opens your OS's file picker when clicked.

An [`<input type="file" />`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file) has many extra features.
It's a [drop zone](#drop-zone) too.
Drop a file on it, and it will behave like you opened that file picker and chose a file. [Neat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm3JodBR-vs)!

After the user selects a file (or multiple) from the file picker, a `"change"` event is fired.
The file(s) will be accessible on `event.target.files`.

It's a [`FileList`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileList).
Every item inside that list is a [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File).

If a single file was selected, it'll be the 0th element in that list.

```html title=index.html
<input type="file" />
```

```js title=index.js
const inputEl = document.querySelector("input");
inputEl.addEventListener("change", (event) => {
  const file = event.target.files[0];
  console.log("A file was selected");
  console.log("Name:", file.name);
});
```

### Drop zone

Another method to get a `File` is using a drop zone.
Dragging and dropping a file is a nice user experience.

<Aside variant="info">

By default, the browser prevents anything from happening when dropping something onto most HTML elements.

To change that, the element must handle both the [`"dragover"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/dragover_event) and [`"drop"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/drop_event) events.

</Aside>

Each handler calls [`event.preventDefault()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault) to prevent further processing of the event.

You also might want to call [`event.stopPropagation()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation) in each handler.
It's not required, but allowing the events to continue propagating can lead to unwanted behaviour.

> I think it's a bit weird too, but it's necessary.

The file(s) are accessible under `event.dataTransfer.files` in the `"drop"` event handler.

Alternatively, you can use the [`DataTransferItemList` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransferItemList) to access the file(s).
This API is handy if you also want to support the dropping of things that are **not** `File` objects.

```html title=index.html
<div>Welcome to THE DROP ZONE</div>
```

<MultiLangCode values={[{label: "dataTransfer.files"}, {label: "dataTransfer.items"}]}>

```js title=index.js
const dropZoneEl = document.querySelector("div");
dropZoneEl.addEventListener("dragover", (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
});
dropZoneEl.addEventListener("drop", (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  console.log("Something was dropped");

  const file = event.dataTransfer.files[0];
  console.log("Name:", file.name);
});
```

```js title=index.js hl=9-12
const dropZoneEl = document.querySelector("div");
dropZoneEl.addEventListener("dragover", (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
});
dropZoneEl.addEventListener("drop", (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  console.log("Something was dropped");

  if (event.dataTransfer.items[0].kind === "file") {
    const file = event.dataTransfer.items[0].getAsFile();
    console.log("Name:", file.name);
  }
});
```

</MultiLangCode>

### The The File System Access API

The [File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API) is fairly new at the time of writing and available in Chromium browsers (Chrome and Edge).

It differs from the previous methods in that you first get a file **handle**, which in turn lets you get the underlying file.

A benefit of this is that you can use that handle to also **write** to the file.

You get one (or multiple) [`FileSystemFileHandle`(s)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystemFileHandle) by calling a method on the [`window`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window).

This opens the OS's file picker and returns a `Promise` that resolves to an array of handles to the file(s) you just picked.  
The file itself can then be accessed by calling the [`getFile`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystemFileHandle/getFile) method on a handle.  
That method returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `File`.

```js title=index.js
const fileHandles = await window.showOpenFilePicker();
const file = await fileHandles[0].getFile();
console.log("A file was selected");
console.log("Name:", file.name);
```

<Aside variant="info">

You can also access the handle to a directory by calling [`window.showDirectoryPicker`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/showDirectoryPicker).

Another neat way to get a filehandle is calling the [`getAsFileSystemHandle`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransferItem/getAsFileSystemHandle) method
on a [`DataTransferItem`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransferItem) during the [drag and drop method](#drop-zone).

</Aside>

## Using a `File`

A `File` is a special kind of [`Blob`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob) and can be used everywhere a `Blob` can.

The metadata directly accessible on a `File` object is browser-specific, what might be there in one browser, may not exist in another.

By metadata I mean properties like `file.name`, `file.type`, `file.size`, ...

The most interesting thing is the contents of that file.
This being the web, there are multiple ways to read that data.

### The `File` API

The [`File` object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) inherits a bunch of methods from `Blob` that can retrieve all the data-y goodness your file holds.

For example [`.text()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob/text) and [`.arrayBuffer()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob/arrayBuffer) return a [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that resolves to a string or an arraybuffer respectively.
While [`.stream()`]() returns a [`ReadableStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream).

Lots of options!

- Is the file an image and do you want to draw it in a `<canvas>`?
  No problem!
  Call [`createImageBitmap(file)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/createImageBitmap) and feed it to the canvas' [`drawImage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/drawImage) method.

- Do you want to represent the data as a [Data URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URLs)?
  Some example usages of those is populating the `src` attribute of a `<video>` or `<img>` tag.

- The `URL` API has a [`createObjectURL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL) method that accepts a `Blob`!

### The `FileReader` API

The [`FileReader` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader) is an event based API.
A reader fires events you can listen to by defining an [`addEventListener`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener).

You can kick off an action for the reader to take by calling one of its methods: [`readAsText`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader/readAsText),
[`readAsArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader/readAsArrayBuffer),
[`readAsDataURL`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader/readAsDataURL),
[`readAsText`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader/readAsText),
or [`readAsBinaryString`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader/readAsBinaryString).

Once that action completes, the reader will fire the `"load"` event, and the result will be available on `reader.result`.

<Aside variant="danger">

The usage of [`readAsBinaryString`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader/readAsBinaryString) is discouraged.
Prefer [`readAsArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader/readAsArrayBuffer).

</Aside>

This event-based API allows a bit more flexibility than using the `Promises` of the `File` API,
like showing a progress bar by listening to the `"progress"` event the reader will periodically fire while reading a file.

<Aside variant="info">

You may want to manually send an [`Event`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) to the reader.

An example is making a reader fire the `"error"` event while testing:
`reader.dispatchEvent(new Event("error"));`

</Aside>

```js title=index.js
const file = /* a File object */;
const reader = new FileReader();

reader.addEventListener("load", (event) => {
  console.log("Successfully read:", file.name);
  console.log("Text contents:", reader.result);
})

reader.readAsText(file);
```

## Writing to files

Once you have a handle to a file, you can call the [`createWritable` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystemFileHandle/createWritable)
to get a [`FileSystemWritableFileStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystemWritableFileStream), which can be used to write to that file.

The snippet below writes "BOOP" to a file. Glorious.

```html title=index.html
<button>choose a file to write to</button>
```

```js title=index.js
const button = document.querySelector("button");

button.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  const handle = await window.showSaveFilePicker();
  const writable = await handle.createWritable();
  await writable.write("BOOP");
  await writable.close();
});
```

In the tweet below, I choose a file and then append either "boop" or "potato" to the file, depending on which button is clicked:

## Demo & code

Try selecting a video, an image, or a text file with any of the three input methods in the demo underneath.

By looking at the `file.type`, the demo determines how it should read the file.
If it's a video or an image, it reads the contents as a data URL and sets the `src` for a `<video>` or `<img>` tag.

Anything else, and it reads and displays the plain text that's inside that file.
