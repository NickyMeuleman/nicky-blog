Accounts. We all have them, the amount of accounts a single person controls varies widly.

A quick internet search revealed that the average user had [90 accounts. In 2015!](https://trello.com/c/2qHMdPWM/38-http-blogdashlanecom-infographic-online-overload-its-worse-than-you-thought)
How accurate that number is, no idea. The point is, it's _a lot_.

By far the most popular method to secure an account is with a password.

## Passwords

Because password are so popular to secure accounts, nefarious individuals have made it their mission to find out your secret password.
And so begins an eternal armsrace.

Many methods of discovering/cracking passwords exists.

If a password is too short, that means it's vulnerable to a [brute force attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack).  
If it's a common word or sentence, that means it's vulnerable to a [dictionary attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack).

The brute force method is not very popular.
In an early scene of [Portal 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_2), a small robot named Wheatley uses this method with ... limited ... success.

### Picking a better password

7-8 characters is not long enough

Passwords in general are not a rigidly secure way to authenticate.
A long and complicated one is hard to remember. Making it easier to remember will often reduce the security of the password.
As a result, a lot of passwords are hard for a human to remember, and easy for a computer to crack.

The [XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/936/) mentions this problem and proposes a method that keeps the security of longer, complicated passwords while making them easier to remember.

![XKCD on choosing passwords. https://xkcd.com/license.html](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png)

The proposed password is `correcthorsebatterystaple`.

- This is long enough not to be vulnerable to a brute force attack.
- It's not going to be extremely vulnerable to a dictionary attack, because the words are random and seemingly have no relation.

<Aside variant="danger">

Don't use `correcthorsebatterystaple` as your password.  
The comic got so popular, it's certainly very vulnerable to any password cracking attempt now.

### A manager

We previously discussed making a single password more secure.

That's fine, but you shouldn't share passwords between accounts.
That means the amount of passwords you have to remember increases with the amount of accounts you have.
Unsustainable. Even if you manage to remember them all, they're probably less complicated and secure than if you remembered a single one.

The solution? Not remembering many passwords, but one really good one.

In other words: **use a password manager.**

A password manager acts like a vault that houses info to a bunch of login names and associated passwords.
One of the popular methods to get access to a vault is with a "master password". Simplified, it's the one password that grants access.

Nearly all of them come with a way to randomly generate a password that will be way more complex than one you could reasonably remember.
