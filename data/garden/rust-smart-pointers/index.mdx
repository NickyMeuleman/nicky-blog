## Pointers

A pointer is a variable that contains an address in memory.
It points to, or _refers_ to some other data.
You can think of it like an arrow to that value.

Rust has two regular types of pointers, called references.
They're recognized by the ampersand in front of a variable name.

- `&` for an immutable reference (eg. `&my_variable`).
- `&mut` for a mutable reference. (eg. `&mut my_variable`)

References to a value don't own that value, they _borrow_ that value.
In other words, the reference can disappear and the value it pointed at will still exist.

The Rust programming language book has [a great chapter on ownership in Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html).

<Aside variant="info">

The Rust [the data race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) prevention dictates that for a given piece of data, in any particular scope:

You can have only **one mutable reference** to that data **OR** you can have **multiple immutable references** to that data.
Never both at the same time.

</Aside>

You might recognize the term "shared reference" from compiler errors.
A while back, I got a compiler error that said something like `blablabla, because it is behind a shared reference`.
This confused me, I got that error while the message indicated a reference that was the only one in the entire program.
How could it be "shared" then?
Turns out that in many cases, "shared reference" is an other way to say "immutable reference".

- An other name for an immutable reference is a shared reference.
- An other name for a mutable reference is an exclusive reference.

## Smart pointers

Those references are regular pointers that only point to some data, they don't have any other capabilities.
Smart pointers can have extra capabilities.
They are data structures that not only act like a pointer, but have additional metadata.
They use that extra data to enable behavior regular pointers could not have.

You could say that those pointers are ... smart

Smart pointers are usually implemented using a struct.
An other difference with regular references, smart pointers usually own the data they point to.
In other words: when the smart pointer gets dropped, the data they point to gets dropped.

Most smart pointers implement the [`Deref`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Deref.html), and [`Drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html) traits.

### String

If you've programmed in Rust before, chances are great you already used smart pointer, even if you didn't know you were.

The `String` is a smart pointer.

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
```

On the left of the following image is the data that is stored on the stack.
On the right, the data that is stored on the heap.

<Aside variant="info">

Psst, I wrote about [the stack and the heap in Rust](/garden/rust-stack-heap)

</Aside>

On the stack is our `String`, named `s1`.
It's a struct that not only has a pointer to a specific location on the heap (in `ptr`).
It has additional metadata, like the length of the string (in `len`), and the amount of bytes that string occupied (in `capacity`).
The distinction between those last 2 fields is not important right now, what is important is that the string has additional metadata associated with it.

The heap stores the contents of that string in consecutive memory addresses.
In this case the letters `h`, `e`, `l`, `l`, `o`.

### Deref

The [`Deref`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Deref.html) trait allows a struct that implements it to behave like a pointer, instead of as a regular struct that holds a pointer in a field.
That way you can write code that works for references, and smart pointers will work with it.

The dereference operator, `*`, follows a pointer to the value it is pointing to.
Calling it on a regular struct wouldn't work, but a struct that implements [`Deref`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Deref.html) knows what to do when that happens.

To implement the [`Deref`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Deref.html) trait, you have to implement a method named `deref`.
It takes an immutable reference to `self`, and returns an immutable reference to an other type.

<Aside variant="danger">

In my opinion, the `deref` method is incredibly confusing naming.
`deref` doesn't dereference at all, it returns a reference.
The compiler knows how to dereference _that_ reference.

</Aside>

The [`Box<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html) type is a smart pointer that implements [`Deref`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Deref.html).

When you use the dereference operator a [`Box<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html), under the hood, a call to the `deref` method happens first.
`deref` returns another reference.
For [`Box<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html), that's a reference to the inner type, the `T` in [`Box<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html).
The compiler then dereferences it by following _that_ reference.

```rust
let num = 5;
let boxed_num = Box::new(num);

assert_eq!(5, num);
assert_eq!(5, *boxed_num);
```

In the first `assert_eq`, we directly compare `5` with `num`.  
In the second `assert_eq`, we compare `5` with the result of using the dereference operator on a boxed value.

`*boxed_num` is equivalent to writing `*(boxed_num.deref())`.

### Drop

The [`Drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html) trait allows you to customize the code that runs when an instance of that struct (a smart pointer) goes out of scope.
It is used to release resources like network connections, files, and used memory.

An example usage: when the owner of a [`Box<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html) goes out of scope,
not only is the `Box` popped off the stack, the `T` that uses memory on the heap is deallocated.

To implement the [`Drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html) trait, you have to implement a method named `drop`.
It takes a mutable reference to `self`, and doesn't return anything. (well, it returns the unit type, the empty tuple, `()`)

That `drop` is called automatically when the owner of a value goes out of scope.
In other words: if a variable leaves the curly bois `{}` that denote a scope, `drop` is called on that variable.

<Aside variant="danger">

It's not allowed to call the `drop` method in the [`Drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Drop.html) trait manually.
At least not directly.
Doing so during a scope would cause the method to be called again, automatically, at the end of that scope.

That would cause unwanted situations, or the infamous _double free_ error where you try to deallocate a piece of memory twice.
If you want to call `drop` before the end of the scope, call it via [`std::mem::drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.drop.html).
That will make sure `drop` is only called once.
