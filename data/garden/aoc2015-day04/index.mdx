</Aside>

Santa needs help mining AdventCoin to use as stocking stuffers.

To do this, he needs to find [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) hashes that start with at least 5 zeros in [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal).

Today's input is a secret key.

An example input looks like this:

```txt title=input.txt
abcdef
```

2 parts form the input to the MD5 hash:
1. The secret key
2. A number (an integer without leading zeros)

- If your secret key is abcdef, the lowest number that produces a hash that starts with 5 zeros is 609043.
The MD5 hash of abcdef609043 start with 000001dbbfa...
- If your secret key is pqrstuv, the lowest number that produces a hash that starts with 5 zeros is 1048970.
The MD5 hash of pqrstuv1048970 starts with 000006136ef...

## Part 1

The question asks for the lowest number that produces a hexadecimal MD5 hash that starts with 5 zeros.

### Option 1: A for loop

Some skeleton/pseudo-code to start with:

```rust
for num in 0.. {
    let input = key + num; // string concatenation
    let hash = md5(input);
    if hash starts with 5 zeros {
        return num;
    }
}
```

A bruteforce algorithm that calculates the hash 1 at a time and checks if it contains 5 zeros.

I'm not going to write the MD5 algorithm myself.
Time for code someone else wrote, the [`md-5` crate](https://crates.io/crates/md-5)

An MD5 hash is 16 bytes.

A byte is often represented as a pair of hexadecimal characters. 
Singular hex characters go from `0` to `F`, so those pairs go from `00` to `FF`.
In decimal that would be from `0` to `255`.

The result of the `MD5` implementation I used returns those 16 bytes in a list.

There are 3 steps to get that list:
1. Create a `hasher`
2. Put bytes into it
3. Tell it to create a hash with that input

```rust
use md5::{Digest, Md5};

let key = "abcde";
let num = 0;

let mut hasher = Md5::new();
hasher.update(key);
hasher.update(num.to_string().as_bytes());
let hash = hasher.finalize();
```

That's the part that creates a hash dealt with.
Now the part that checks that hash (does it start with 5 zeros?).

The first byte contains information for the first 2 hex characters.
The second byte contains information for the next 2 hex characters.

If a byte is zero, both hex characters are zero.

We check if first four hex characters are 0 by checking if their entire byte is 0.
`hash[0] == 0 && hash[1] == 0`

The 5th hex character is the first character of a pair.
With some bit logic we turn the second character into a 0.
Then we check if the resulting number is 0:
`hash[2] & 0xF0 == 0`

That turns the entire check into:
```rust
if (hash[0] == 0) && (hash[1] == 0) && ((hash[2] & 0xF0) == 0) {
    // the first five characters of the hexadecimal MD5 are 0
}
```

This can be written a bit differently.
We [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR) every part first
If the result is 0, they were all 0.

```rust
if hash[0] | hash[1] | (hash[2] & 0xF0) == 0 {
    // the first five characters of the hexadecimal MD5 are 0
}
```

Putting it all together.
I pulled the `hasher` outside of the `for` loop to reuse it.
Creating a new one every iteration works too, reusing it avoids a bit of unnecessary work.
This means the call to `finalize()` turns into a call to `finalize_reset()`, clearing the `hasher` so it's ready for the next loop.

```rust
use md5::{Digest, Md5};

pub fn part_1(input: &str) -> u64 {
    let key = input.as_bytes();
    let mut hasher = Md5::new();

    for num in 0.. {
        hasher.update(key);
        hasher.update(num.to_string().as_bytes());
        let result = hasher.finalize_reset();
        // an item in the result array is a byte represented by 2 hex characters: 00 to FF
        // check if both hex characters at idx 0 are 0
        // check if both hex characters at idx 1 are 0
        // check if first hex character at idx 2 is 0
        if (result[0] == 0) && (result[1] == 0) && ((result[2] & 0xf0) == 0) {
            return num;
        }
    }

    unreachable!()
}
```

### Option 2: An iterator chain

This uses an open range again to loop from 0 until the maximum possible number.

The used number is indentical to the index in that sequence.
When a hash with 5 zeros is found, we break the loop and return that index.

```rust
pub fn part_1(input: &str) -> usize {
    let key = input.as_bytes();
    let mut hasher = Md5::new();

    (0..)
        .map(|num| {
            hasher.update(key);
            hasher.update(num.to_string().as_bytes());
            hasher.finalize_reset()
        })
        .position(|result| result[0] | result[1] | (result[2] & 0xF0) == 0)
        .unwrap()
}
```

### Option 3: Parallellize it

This problem requires a bunch of work that can be split up, a great scenario for [multi threading](/blog/multithreading-rust).

I decided to slightly tweak the solution with the iterator chain.
The [`rayon` crate](https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/index.html) provides the tools to convert that code with minimal changes.

The open range explicitly has an end point now.
This lets us convert the iterator chain to a [parallel iterator](https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/iter/index.html).

The call to `position` turned into [a call to `rayon`'s `position_first`](https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/iter/trait.IndexedParallelIterator.html#method.position_first).

Notice the `hasher` is inside the loop again.

```rust
use md5::{Digest, Md5};
use rayon::prelude::*;

pub fn part_1(input: &str) -> usize {
    let key = input.as_bytes();

    (0..usize::MAX)
        .into_par_iter()
        .map(|num| {
            let mut hasher = Md5::new();
            hasher.update(key);
            hasher.update(num.to_string().as_bytes());
            hasher.finalize()
        })
        .position_first(|result| result[0] | result[1] | (result[2] & 0xF0) == 0)
        .unwrap()
}
```

Curiously, on my machine (an older intel quadcore without hyperthreading),
the gains from multithreading do not outweight the added overhead.
The algorithm was marginally slower multithreaded than the same one ran sequentially.

### Bonus: Avoiding string allocations

In every loop, we turn the number into a `String` only to immediately feed it to the `hasher`.

```rust
hasher.update(num.to_string());
```

Avoiding that `String` creation can speed up the solution.

Using [a crate like `numtoa`](https://docs.rs/numtoa/latest/numtoa/) can help with this.

The `for` loop code then turns into:
```rust hl=7,10
use md5::{Digest, Md5};
use numtoa::NumToA;

pub fn part_1(input: &str) -> u64 {
    let mut hasher = Md5::new();
    let key = input.as_bytes();
    let mut buffer = [0u8; 20];
    for num in 0.. {
        hasher.update(key);
        hasher.update(num.numtoa(10, &mut buffer));
        let result = hasher.finalize_reset();
        if result[0] | result[1] | (result[2] & 0xf0) == 0 {
            return num;
        }
    }

    unreachable!()
}
```

### Main code for part 1

```rust title=day_04.rs
use md5::{Digest, Md5};

pub fn part_1(input: &str) -> usize {
    let key = input.as_bytes();
    let mut hasher = Md5::new();
    (0..)
        .map(|num| {
            hasher.update(key);
            hasher.update(num.to_string().as_bytes());
            hasher.finalize_reset()
        })
        .position(|result| result[0] | result[1] | (result[2] & 0xF0) == 0)
        .unwrap()
}
```

## Part 2

The question asks for the lowest number that produces a hexadecimal MD5 hash that starts with 6 zeros.

The code is almost identical to part 1.

That special logic to deal with the 5'th hex character can be deleted now.

The part where we check if a hash starts with zeroes changes to:
```rust
result[0] | result[1] | result[2] == 0
```

Ironically, this makes part2 simpler to code than part1.

### Main code for part 2

```rust title=day_04.rs
use md5::{Digest, Md5};

pub fn part_2(input: &str) -> usize {
    let key = input.as_bytes();
    let mut hasher = Md5::new();

    (0..)
        .map(|num| {
            hasher.update(key);
            hasher.update(num.to_string().as_bytes());
            hasher.finalize_reset()
        })
        .position(|result| result[0] | result[1] | result[2] == 0)
        .unwrap()
}
```

## Final code

```rust title=day_04.rs numberLines
use md5::{Digest, Md5};

pub fn part_1(input: &str) -> usize {
    let key = input.as_bytes();
    let mut hasher = Md5::new();

    (0..)
        .map(|num| {
            hasher.update(key);
            hasher.update(num.to_string().as_bytes());
            hasher.finalize_reset()
        })
        .position(|result| result[0] | result[1] | (result[2] & 0xF0) == 0)
        .unwrap()
}

pub fn part_2(input: &str) -> usize {
    let key = input.as_bytes();
    let mut hasher = Md5::new();

    (0..)
        .map(|num| {
            hasher.update(key);
            hasher.update(num.to_string().as_bytes());
            hasher.finalize_reset()
        })
        .position(|result| result[0] | result[1] | result[2] == 0)
        .unwrap()
}
```
