## Day 7: No Space Left On Device

  TL;DR: [my solution in

Yesterday, we got a communication device from an elf.

It needs a software update and there is not enough free space to apply it.

We browse around the file system using the command line and record what it displays.
That's our puzzle input for today.

An example input looks like this:

```txt title=input.txt
$ cd /
$ ls
dir a
14848514 b.txt
8504156 c.dat
dir d
$ cd a
$ ls
dir e
29116 f
2557 g
62596 h.lst
$ cd e
$ ls
584 i
$ cd ..
$ cd ..
$ cd d
$ ls
4060174 j
8033020 d.log
5626152 d.ext
7214296 k
```

A line that starts with a `$` indicates a command we typed.

- `cd` means **change directory**, it changes the current directory that future commands affect.
    - `cd ..` goes **up** a directory (to the parent directory).
    - `cd X` moves **down** a directory, to the child directory named `X`.
    - `cd /` is a special case of `cd X` where the current directory moves all the way up, to the root of the file tree.
- `ls` means **list**, it prints all files and directories the current directory contains.

The files and directories shown by `ls` are represented as seperate lines in the input.

- Files start with the size of a file, followed by a space, and then the name of the file.
    - So line `123 abc` is a file that has a size of `123`, and is named `abc`.
- Directories start with `dir`, followed by a space, and then the name of the directory.
    - So line `dir xyz` is a directory named `xyz`.

With the input, we can completely map out the filesystem starting at the root directory, `/`.

The total size of a directory is the sum of the sizes of all the files it contains, including the ones that are inside subfolders.


## Part 1

The question asks to find the sum of all directories with a size of **at most 100000**.


My goal was to build up a map of all directories where the key is a path, and the value is the size of the directory at that path.
Then I could filter out every entry that is too big, and sum up the remaining ones.

```rust
sizes
    .values()
    .filter(|size| *size <= 100_000)
    .sum()
```

I kept track of 2 variables.
- One that holds the map of path to size. (the `HashMap` called `sizes`)
- One with a list of all paths that are affected if we encounter a new file. (the `Vec` called `affected`)

If we encounter a file, then its size should be added to all paths above it.

- Every time I `cd` **down**, the name gets added to the end of `affected`.
- Every time I `cd` **up**, the last item in `affected` gets removed.

Every file I encounter, I add its size to all paths that are affected.

I loop through `affected` to construct the affected paths, and add the size to that path's entry in `sizes`.

The affected path can be built by constructing a path from increasing amounts of items in `affected`.

For example, if `affected` was `["/", "a", "b", "a"]`, the affected paths would be:
- `"/"`
- `"/a"`
- `"/a/b"`
- `"/a/b/a"`

I did this by using [a `PathBuf`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/path/struct.PathBuf.html), but any method will do (if this were JavaScript, I'd reach for [`path.join`](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html#pathjoinpaths)).

```rust title=day_07.rs
pub fn part_1() -> u32 {
    let input = std::fs::read_to_string("src/day07.txt").unwrap();
    let mut sizes = HashMap::new();
    let mut affected = Vec::new();

    for line in input.lines() {
        if line.starts_with("$ ls") || line.starts_with("dir") {
            continue;
        }

        let parts: Vec<_> = line.split_whitespace().collect();
        match parts[..] {
            ["$", "cd", ".."] => {
                affected.pop();
            }
            ["$", "cd", name] => {
                affected.push(name);
            }
            [size, _name] => {
                let size: u32 = size.parse().unwrap();
                for idx in 0..affected.len() {
                    let path = PathBuf::from_iter(&affected[..=idx]);
                    *sizes.entry(path).or_insert(0) += size;
                }
            }
            _ => {}
        };
    }

    sizes
        .into_values()
        .filter(|size| *size <= 100_000)
        .sum()
}
```

## Part 2

- The size of the filesystem is 70000000.
- The amount of unused space you need for the update is 30000000.

The question asks to find the size of the smallest directory you can delete to free enough space.

The part where the map of sizes is created is identical to part1.

We keep every directory that would result in enough free space if it's deleted.

The minimum of those options is the answer to part2!

```rust
let disk = 70_000_000;
let needed = 30_000_000;
let root = sizes.get(&PathBuf::from("/")).unwrap();
let available = disk - root;

sizes
    .into_values()
    .filter(|size| available + size >= needed)
    .min()
    .unwrap()
```

```rust title=day_07.rs
pub fn part_2() -> u32 {
    let input = std::fs::read_to_string("src/day07.txt").unwrap();

    let mut sizes = HashMap::new();
    let mut affected = Vec::new();

    for line in input.lines() {
        if line.starts_with("$ ls") || line.starts_with("dir") {
            continue;
        }

        let parts: Vec<_> = line.split_whitespace().collect();
        match parts[..] {
            ["$", "cd", ".."] => {
                affected.pop();
            }
            ["$", "cd", name] => {
                affected.push(name);
            }
            [size, _name] => {
                let size: u32 = size.parse().unwrap();
                for idx in 0..affected.len() {
                    let path = PathBuf::from_iter(&affected[..=idx]);
                    *sizes.entry(path).or_insert(0) += size;
                }
            }
            _ => {}
        };
    }

    let disk = 70_000_000;
    let needed = 30_000_000;
    let root = sizes.get(&PathBuf::from("/")).unwrap();
    let available = disk - root;

    sizes
        .into_values()
        .filter(|size| available + size >= needed)
        .min()
        .unwrap()
}
```
