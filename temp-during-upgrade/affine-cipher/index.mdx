The affine cipher turns letters from one alphabet into letters from the same alphabet.

There are three steps to enciphering/deciphering using the affine cipher.

1. Turn a letter into a number
2. Do math on that number
3. Turn that number into a letter

The second step is where the enciphering and deciphering are different.

<Aside variant="info">

A plaintext letter always maps to the same enciphered letter.
That is a weakness of this cipher, it clearly shows repeated letters in text.

---

The enciphered letter can be the same as the plaintext letter.

---

For this post, it is assumed all inputs are lowercase letters from the English alphabet.

## Values and techniques used

### Keys

The affine cipher uses 2 numerical keys.

These keys are often represented by the variables `a` and `b`.

### Alphabet length

Letters map to a number and the other way around.
For the English alphabet that means "a" is 0, "b" is 1, ..., "z" is 25.

The length of that sequence is used during both enciphering and deciphering.

The alphabet length is often represented by the variable `m`.
For English: `m = 26`.

Key `a` and alphabet length `m` have to be [coprime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime_integers).
That means they're integers with a [greatest common divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of 1.

This requirement exists because it is used while deciphering.
A cipher that can't ever be deciphered isn't very useful now, is it?

### Modulo

The modulus operation is used both in enciphering and deciphering.

While similar, modulus and remainder are **NOT** the same thing!

<Aside variant="danger">

In many programming languages, the `%` symbol is the **remainder** operator.

That means using `%` when you need the modulus operator is a mistake.

---

For two integers `n` and `m`:

Remainder: `n % m`

Modulus: `((n % m) + m) % m`

</Aside>

A modulo operation can be thought of as counting on a circle.  
That circle has as many steps as the modulus you are applying.

Adding 1 to the number we take the modulo of means taking one step clockwise on the circle.

Starting at 0, and incrementing by one every step.  
The result of a modulo calculation starts at 0 and increments by 1 until the maximum is reached.  
Instead of incrementing that maximum, it reaches the top, and starts from 0 again.

In our example, we calculate numbers with a modulus of 26 (the length of the English alphabet).
That means the maximum number is 25.

The same logic is applied for subtracting 1.  
A subtraction by 1 results in 1 step counterclockwise.

### Modular multiplicative inverse

The [modular multiplicative inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse) is used during deciphering.

In modular arithmetic, regular division isn't allowed.  
Instead we multiply by the modular inverse.

In regular arithmetic dividing by $7$ is equivalent to multiplying by ${1 \over 7}$.

In modular arithmetic that inverse is dependent on which modulus is used.

For example, a modular multiplicative inverse of $7$ in $\bmod 26$ is $15$.

We want to find a number (which we'll call $v$) where multiplying by that number in $\bmod 26$ works out to $1$.

- $a$ is $7$
- $w$ is a random integer
- in $\bmod 26$

We want to find $v$ such that:

$$
a * v = 1 \plusmn 26 * w
$$

written differently:

$$
7 * v \cong 1 \pmod {26}
$$

What we just wrote, is a rearranged special case of [Bézout's identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zout%27s_identity).
It says that a multiple of 7 plus a multiple of 26 is equal to the greatest common divisor of 7 and 26.

In the affine cipher, the greatest common divisor is always 1.

<Aside variant="info">

The greatest common divisor is 1 because `a` and `m` are required to be coprime.

</Aside>

{/* can't pass the math as children because * gets automatically changed to _ by markdown-all-in-one */}

<MathBlock
  title="Written as Bezout's identity"
  math={"a * v + m * w = 1 \\newline 7 * v + 26 * w = 1 "}
/>

Remember, the number we're interested in is $a^{-1}$.

<Aside variant="info">

If we find a $v$ where $a * v + 26 * w = 1$.  
That means of $v \bmod {26}$ is $a^{-1}$

</Aside>

The [extended Euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm) calculates the greatest common divisor of 2 numbers along with both factors of [Bézout's identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zout%27s_identity).

$v$ is one of those factors!

By plugging $a$ and $26$ into the algorithm, we get 3 things back.

1. The greatest common divisor of $a$ and $26$, that's $1$.
2. The first integer in [Bézout's identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zout%27s_identity), that's $v$
3. The second integer in [Bézout's identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zout%27s_identity), which is irrelevant.

<MultiLangCode>

```js title=index.js
function egcd(a, b) {
  if (a == 0) {
    return [b, 0, 1];
  }
  if (b == 0) {
    return [a, 1, 0];
  }
  let quotient = Math.floor(b / a);
  let remainder = b % a;
  let [g, x, y] = egcd(remainder, a);
  return [g, y - quotient * x, x];
}
```

```rust title=lib.rs
fn egcd(a: i32, b: i32) -> (i32, i32, i32) {
    match (a, b) {
        (0, _) => (b, 0, 1),
        (_, 0) => (a, 1, 0),
        _ => {
            let quotient = b / a;
            let remainder = b % a;
            let (g, x, y) = egcd(remainder, a);
            (g, y - quotient * x, x)
        }
    }
}
```

</MultiLangCode>

The function to calculate the [modular multiplicative inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse) checks if the greatest common divisor between key `a`, and alphabet length `m` is 1.
If it is, it returns the first Bezout coefficient $\bmod m$, which is $a^{-1}$.

<MultiLangCode>

```js title=index.js
function mmi(a, m) {
  let [gcd, v] = egcd(a, m);
  if (gcd == 1) {
    return ((v % m) + m) % m;
  }
}
```

```rust title=lib.rs
fn mmi(a: i32, m: i32) -> Option<i32> {
    let (g, v, _) = egcd(a, m);
    match g {
        1 => Some(v.rem_euclid(m)),
        _ => None,
    }
}
```

</MultiLangCode>

## Enciphering

### Plaintext letter to number

A plaintext character is mapped to a number.

Our example uses the English alphabet and zero indexes letters.
It maps "a" to 0, "b" to 1, ..., "z" to 25.

In code, we take advantage of the ASCII table.

In ASCII, a lowercase `"a"` is represented by the number 97.

As a result, a character maps to the ASCII value of that character minus 97.

<MultiLangCode>

```js title=index.js
let plaintextNum = plaintextChar.charCodeAt(0) - 97;
```

```rust title=lib.rs
let plaintext_num = plaintext_char as u8 - 97;
```

</MultiLangCode>

### Manipulate the number

- $a$ and $b$ are the key numbers.
- $m$ is the length of the used alphabet.
- $x$ is the number corresponding to the plaintext letter.
- $y$ is the number corresponding to the ciphertext letter before the modulo operation.

The formula for enciphering is $y = a * x + b$.

This is done in $mod \space m$, so in our example it's in $mod \space 26$.

That means the final ciphertext number is $y \space mod \space 26$.

<MultiLangCode>

```js title=index.js
let y = a * x + b;
y = ((y % 26) + 26) % 26;
```

```rust title=lib.rs
let mut y = a * x + b;
y = y.rem_euclid(26);
```

</MultiLangCode>

### Number to enciphered letter

Where we turned a letter into a number previously, we reverse that process.

In code, we use the ASCII table again.

This time, we add 97 to the zero indexed number and look up the resulting letter in the ASCII table.

<MultiLangCode>

```js title=index.js
let ciphertextChar = String.fromCharCode(ciphertextNum + 97);
```

```rust title=lib.rs
let ciphertext_char = (ciphertextNum + 97) as char;
```

</MultiLangCode>

### Demo

## Deciphering

### Enciphered letter to number

This step is identical to the first one while enciphering.

We look up the ASCII code for a lowercase letter, then we subtract the code for a lowercase ASCII `"a"`.
This results in a number that is zero indexed.

<MultiLangCode>

```js title=index.js
let ciphertextNum = ciphertextChar.charCodeAt(0) - 97;
```

```rust title=lib.rs
let ciphertext_num = ciphertext_char as u8 - 97;
```

</MultiLangCode>

### Manipulate the number

- $a$ and $b$ are the key numbers.
- $m$ is the length of the used alphabet.
- $y$ is the number corresponding to the ciphertext letter.
- $x$ is the number corresponding to the plaintext letter before the modulo operation.

The formula for enciphering is $y = a * x + b$.

The formula for deciphering is derived by rewriting that equation.
The goal is to isolate the plaintext letter in the equation.

$$
y = a * x + b
\newline
y - b = a * x
\newline
a^{-1} * (y - b) = x
$$

Rewritten with the plaintext number on the left side:
The formula for deiphering is $x = a^{-1} * (y - b)$.

It is important to remember these calculation are done in $\bmod m$.

That is why we are not allowed to divide by $a$.
Instead, we multiply by the [modular multiplicative inverse](#modular-multiplicative-inverse) of $a \pmod m$.

<MultiLangCode>

```js title=index.js
const inverse = mmi(a, 26);
let x = inverse * (cipherCharNum - b);
x = ((x % 26) + 26) % 26;
```

```rust title=lib.rs
let inverse = mmi(a, 26);
let mut x = inverse * (cipherchar_num - b);
x = x.rem_euclid(26);
```

</MultiLangCode>

### Number to plaintext letter

This step is identical to the last one while enciphering.

We add the number for a lowercase ASCII `"a"` to our zero indexed number.
Then we look up the letter for that number in the ASCII table.

<MultiLangCode>

```js title=index.js
let plaintextChar = String.fromCharCode(plaintextNum + 97);
```

```rust title=lib.rs
let plaintext_char = (plaintext_num + 97) as char;
```
