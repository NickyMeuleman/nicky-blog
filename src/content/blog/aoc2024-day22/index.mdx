## Day 22: Keypad Conundrum

https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/22

<Aside>
  TL;DR: [my solution in
  Rust](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/scrapyard/blob/main/advent_of_code/2024/solutions/src/day_22.rs)
</Aside>

Another day, another [familiar ... adversary](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/11).

A monkey stole the device.

To trade it back, aqcuire ~~currency~~ bananas from the local market.

Every buyer on the market sets their prices seemingly random, but they're not really, they're [pseudorandom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator).
And a sneaky historian hands you the list of seed numbers for the pseudorandom number generator.

An example input looks like this:

```txt title=input.txt
1
10
100
2024
```

The pseudorandom generation goes like this:

1. Number is set to the result of multiplying the secret number by 64.
1. Number is set to the result of dividing the secret number by 32. Round the result down to the nearest integer.
1. Number is set to the result of multiplying the secret number by 2048.

Between each step, mix the step result into the previous number, then prune the number.

- mixing: step result XOR number
- prune: mix result modulo 16777216

Not bothering with a parsing function today, each line is a number.

## Part 1

The question asks for the sum of the 2000th secret number for all buyers.

A "read the instructions and code them" question, nothing special.

```rust title=day_22.rs
fn mix(a: i64, b: i64) -> i64 {
    a ^ b
}

fn prune(a: i64) -> i64 {
    a.rem_euclid(16777216)
}

fn next(mut n: i64) -> i64 {
    n = prune(mix(n * 64, n));
    n = prune(mix(n / 32, n));
    n = prune(mix(n * 2048, n));
    n
}

fn part_1(input: &str) -> usize {
    input
        .lines()
        .map(|line| {
            let mut num = line.parse().unwrap();
            for _ in 0..2000 {
                num = next(num);
            }
            num
        })
        .sum()
}
```

## Part 2

You figured out what every buyer's secret numbers are going to be.
That means you know what their prices are going to be.

A price is the last digit of a secret number.

You've got stuff to sell, and want as much bananas as possible.

You instruct a monkey to sell one thing when it sees a specific sequence of 4 consecutive differences in price.
This sequence is the same for every buyer, and the monkey only sells the first time it sees the sequence (or not at all if it doesn't see the sequence).

The question asks what the most bananas you can get is.

The code builds up a map that maps a specific sequence to an amount of bananas it gets from all buyers combined.
The answer to the question is the maximum value in that map.

For each buyer:
1. Generate 2000 prices (the last digit of each pseudorandom number).
1. Looks through sliding windows of 5 numbers (so 4 differences).
This produces a sequence of differences, and a price at that sequence.
The first time that specific sequence is seen, put it into the map.

```rust title=day_22.rs
fn part_2(input: &str) -> i64 {
    let mut profitmap = HashMap::new();

    for line in input.lines() {
        let mut num = line.parse().unwrap();
        let mut prices = [0; 2000];
        for price in prices.iter_mut() {
            num = next(num);
            *price = num.rem_euclid(10);
        }

        let mut seen = HashSet::new();
        for (a, b, c, d, e) in prices.iter().tuple_windows() {
            let diffs = ((b - a), (c - b), (d - c), (e - d));
            // only buy once
            if seen.insert(diffs) {
                *profitmap.entry(diffs).or_default() += *e;
            }
        }
    }

    *profitmap.values().max().unwrap()
}
```

## Final code

```rust title=day_22.rs showLineNumbers
use itertools::Itertools;
use std::collections::{HashMap, HashSet};

fn mix(a: i64, b: i64) -> i64 {
    a ^ b
}

fn prune(a: i64) -> i64 {
    a.rem_euclid(16777216)
}

fn next(mut n: i64) -> i64 {
    n = prune(mix(n * 64, n));
    n = prune(mix(n / 32, n));
    n = prune(mix(n * 2048, n));
    n
}

pub fn part_1(input: &str) -> i64 {
    input
        .lines()
        .map(|line| {
            let mut num = line.parse().unwrap();
            for _ in 0..2000 {
                num = next(num);
            }
            num
        })
        .sum()
}

pub fn part_2(input: &str) -> i64 {
    let mut profitmap = HashMap::new();

    for line in input.lines() {
        let mut num = line.parse().unwrap();
        let mut prices = [0; 2000];
        for price in prices.iter_mut() {
            num = next(num);
            *price = num.rem_euclid(10);
        }

        let mut seen = HashSet::new();
        for (a, b, c, d, e) in prices.iter().tuple_windows() {
            let diffs = ((b - a), (c - b), (d - c), (e - d));
            // only sell once
            if seen.insert(diffs) {
                *profitmap.entry(diffs).or_default() += *e;
            }
        }
    }

    *profitmap.values().max().unwrap()
}
```
