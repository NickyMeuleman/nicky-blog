## Day 20: Pulse Propagation

https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/20

<Aside>
TL;DR: [my solution in Rust](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/scrapyard/blob/main/advent_of_code/2023/solutions/src/day_20.rs)
</Aside>

The elves fixed the sand machines, but they need to be booted up.

The machines are connected with cables, and each machine has a communication module attached to it.

Those modules communicate using pulses, either a high pulse, of a low pulse.

A module sends its pulse to all of its destination modules.

Today's input describes to grid of modules.

An example input looks like this:
```txt title=input.txt
broadcaster -> a, b, c
%a -> b
%b -> c
%c -> inv
&inv -> a
```

Each line describes a module:
- To the left of the arrow is the source module.
- To the right of the arrow are its destination modules

A module can have several types:
1. A flipflop module, its name is prefixed with a `%`
2. A conjugation module, its name is prefixed with a `&`
3. The broadcaster module, each grid has one of these

## Module behaviour

Flip-flop modules (prefix %) are either on or off.
They are initially off.
If a flip-flop module receives a high pulse, it is ignored and nothing happens.
However, if a flip-flop module receives a low pulse, it flips between on and off.
If it was off, it turns on and sends a high pulse. If it was on, it turns off and sends a low pulse.

Conjunction modules (prefix &) remember the type of the most recent pulse received from each of their connected input modules.
They initially default to remembering a low pulse for each input.
When a pulse is received, the conjunction module first updates its memory for that input.
Then, if it remembers high pulses for all inputs, it sends a low pulse; otherwise, it sends a high pulse.

There is a single broadcast module (named broadcaster).
When it receives a pulse, it sends the same pulse to all of its destination modules.

The button module.
When you push the button, a single low pulse is sent directly to the broadcaster module.

---

Pulses are processed in the order they are sent.
In other words, every time a pulse is sent, push onto the back of queue.
The next pulse to be processed is the next pulse you pop off the front of the queue.

## Parsing

I parsed the input into 2 maps.
1. From a name to a list of destinations
2. From a name to a module

A module:
```rust
enum Module<'a> {
    FlipFlop {
        on: bool,
    },
    Conjunction {
        memory: HashMap<&'a str, PulseStrength>,
    },
    Broadcaster,
}
```

A flipflop module has an internal boolean to determine if it's on.

The memory of a conjugation module keeps track of the previous strength each of its input modules sent previously.
```rust
enum PulseStrength {
    Low,
    High,
}
```

```rust
fn parse_line(s: &str) -> (&str, Module, Vec<&str>) {
    let (lhs, rhs) = s.split_once(" -> ").unwrap();
    let outputs: Vec<&str> = rhs.split(", ").collect();
    let module = match &lhs[0..1] {
        "b" => Module::Broadcaster,
        // Flipflop modules are initially off.
        "%" => Module::FlipFlop { on: false },
        "&" => Module::Conjunction {
            memory: HashMap::new(),
        },
        _ => panic!(),
    };
    let name = if module == Module::Broadcaster {
        lhs
    } else {
        &lhs[1..]
    };

    (name, module, outputs)
}

fn parse(input: &str) -> (HashMap<&str, Vec<&str>>, HashMap<&str, Module>) {
    let mut destmap = HashMap::new();
    let mut modulemap = HashMap::new();

    for (name, module, destinations) in input.lines().map(|line| parse_line(line)) {
        modulemap.insert(name, module);
        destmap.insert(name, destinations);
    }

    // set the initial remembered pulses to a low pulse for every module that's connected to a conjuction module
    for (source, destinations) in &destmap {
        for destination in destinations {
            if let Some(Module::Conjunction { memory }) = modulemap.get_mut(destination) {
                memory.insert(source, PulseStrength::Low);
            }
        }
    }

    (destmap, modulemap)
}
```

## Part 1

Press the button 1000 times.
The question asks what you get if you multiply the total number of low pulses sent by the total number of high pulses sent?

### Helpers

The queue holds a `Pulse`s:
```rust
struct Pulse<'a> {
    from: &'a str,
    to: &'a str,
    strength: PulseStrength,
}
```

A method on `Pulse` that allows it to be sent.
It figures out which pulse strength it would send (if any), and then sends that pulse to all of its destinations (by pushing a new `Pulse` onto the queue).

```rust
impl<'a> Pulse<'a> {
    fn send(
        self,
        modulemap: &mut HashMap<&'a str, Module>,
        destmap: &HashMap<&'a str, Vec<&'a str>>,
        q: &mut VecDeque<Pulse<'a>>,
    ) {
        let Some(module) = modulemap.get_mut(self.to) else {
            // hit the rx module, it doesn't send anything
            return;
        };

        // figure out which pulse to send, if any
        let send = match module {
            Module::FlipFlop { on } => match self.strength {
                // If a flip-flop module receives a high pulse, it is ignored and nothing happens.
                PulseStrength::High => None,
                // However, if a flip-flop module receives a low pulse, it flips between on and off.
                // If it was off, it turns on and sends a high pulse. If it was on, it turns off and sends a low pulse.
                PulseStrength::Low => {
                    *on = !*on;
                    let strength = if *on {
                        PulseStrength::High
                    } else {
                        PulseStrength::Low
                    };
                    Some(strength)
                }
            },
            Module::Conjunction { memory } => {
                // When a pulse is received, the conjunction module first updates its memory for that input.
                *memory.get_mut(self.from).unwrap() = self.strength;
                // then, if it remembers high pulses for all inputs, it sends a low pulse; otherwise, it sends a high pulse.
                let strength = if memory
                    .values()
                    .all(|&strength| strength == PulseStrength::High)
                {
                    PulseStrength::Low
                } else {
                    PulseStrength::High
                };
                Some(strength)
            }
            // There is a single broadcast module (named broadcaster).
            // When it receives a pulse, it sends the same pulse to all of its destination modules.
            Module::Broadcaster => Some(self.strength),
        };

        // send pulses to all destinations
        if let Some(strength) = send {
            for &to in destmap.get(self.to).unwrap() {
                let pulse = Pulse {
                    from: self.to,
                    to,
                    strength,
                };
                q.push_back(pulse);
            }
        };
    }
}
```

### Code

```rust title=day_20.rs
pub fn part_1(input: &str) -> u64 {
    let (destmap, mut modulemap) = parse(input);

    let mut low_count = 0;
    let mut high_count = 0;

    for _ in 0..1_000 {
        let mut q = VecDeque::new();
        q.push_back(Pulse {
            from: "button",
            to: "broadcaster",
            strength: PulseStrength::Low,
        });
        while let Some(pulse) = q.pop_front() {
            match pulse.strength {
                PulseStrength::Low => low_count += 1,
                PulseStrength::High => high_count += 1,
            }
            pulse.send(&mut modulemap, &destmap, &mut q)
        }
    }

    low_count * high_count
}
```

## Part 2

The final module is named `"rx"`.
The machine turns on when a single low pulse is sent to `"rx"`.

The question asks what the fewest number of button presses required to deliver a single low pulse to the module named rx is.

---

This part required some investigation of the input file.

The singular module before `"rx"` is always a conjugation module.

So if all modules connected to that module have previously sent a high strength signal, it will send a low strength signal.

That's the condition to look for, after how many button presses does that happen?

I kept track of how many button presses it takes for each module connected to that final conjugation module to send a high signal.

If I've seen all those modules sent a high signal, I determine when they would have all sent one previously.

Like previous days, this is the least common multiple of all individual button presses.

### Helpers

A way to calculate the least common multiple of 2 numbers:
```rust
fn gcd(mut a: u64, mut b: u64) -> u64 {
    while b != 0 {
        let tmp = a;
        a = b;
        b = tmp % b;
    }
    a
}

fn lcm(a: u64, b: u64) -> u64 {
    a * b / gcd(a, b)
}
```

### Code

```rust title=day_20.rs
pub fn part_2(input: &str) -> u64 {
    let (destmap, mut modulemap) = parse(input);
    let (before_rx, _) = destmap
        .iter()
        .find(|(_, destinations)| destinations.contains(&"rx"))
        .unwrap();
    let Module::Conjunction { memory } = modulemap.get(before_rx).unwrap() else {
        panic!("module before rx should be a conjunction")
    };

    // since the module before rx is a conjunction, is needs all its inputs to have sent a high signal in order to send a low signal
    // remember after how many presses an input to before_rx sent a high signal
    let mut tracker: HashMap<&str, Option<u64>> = memory.keys().map(|&name| (name, None)).collect();

    for presses in 1.. {
        let mut q = VecDeque::new();
        q.push_back(Pulse {
            from: "button",
            to: "broadcaster",
            strength: PulseStrength::Low,
        });

        while let Some(pulse) = q.pop_front() {
            if pulse.to == *before_rx && pulse.strength == PulseStrength::High {
                *tracker.get_mut(pulse.from).unwrap() = Some(presses);
                // if all inputs to before_rx have a known presscount, figure out when they all send a high signal at the same time
                if tracker.values().all(|presses| presses.is_some()) {
                    return tracker
                        .values()
                        .map(|presses| presses.unwrap())
                        .fold(1, |acc, curr| lcm(acc, curr));
                }
            }

            pulse.send(&mut modulemap, &destmap, &mut q)
        }
    }

    panic!("No solution")
}
```
