## Day 20: Race Condition

https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/20

<Aside>
  TL;DR: [my solution in
  Rust](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/scrapyard/blob/main/advent_of_code/2024/solutions/src/day_20.rs)
</Aside>

Another day, another [familiar sensation](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/24).
This time, you're inside a computer again, near the CPU.

There is a race being held, on a ... drumroll please ... 2D-grid!

An example input looks like this:

```txt title=input.txt
###############
#...#...#.....#
#.#.#.#.#.###.#
#S#...#.#.#...#
#######.#.#.###
#######.#.#...#
#######.#.###.#
###..E#...#...#
###.#######.###
#...###...#...#
#.#####.#.###.#
#.#...#.#.#...#
#.#.#.#.#.#.###
#...#...#...###
###############
```

- `#`: wall
- `.`: empty
- `S`: start, also empty
- `E`: end, also empty

- There is only one shortest route from the start to the end.
- You can go in the 4 main directions.
- Each step costs 1

## Parsing

Let's get the `Point` and `Tile` out again.
Return a `Point` for start, one for end, and the grid as a map from `Point`s to `Tile`s.

Again, this is not the most efficient way to store the grid, but one I like a lot.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Clone, Copy)]
struct Point {
    row: i32,
    col: i32,
}

impl Point {
    fn new(row: i32, col: i32) -> Self {
        Self { row, col }
    }
}

#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Clone, Copy)]
enum Tile {
    Empty,
    Wall,
}

fn parse(input: &str) -> (Point, Point, HashMap<Point, Tile>) {
    let mut start = Point::new(0, 0);
    let mut end = Point::new(0, 0);
    let mut grid = HashMap::new();

    for (row, line) in input.lines().enumerate() {
        for (col, c) in line.chars().enumerate() {
            let point = Point::new(row as i32, col as i32);
            let tile = match c {
                '.' => Tile::Empty,
                '#' => Tile::Wall,
                'S' => {
                    start.row = row as i32;
                    start.col = col as i32;
                    Tile::Empty
                }
                'E' => {
                    end.row = row as i32;
                    end.col = col as i32;
                    Tile::Empty
                }
                _ => panic!("at the disco"),
            };
            grid.insert(point, tile);
        }
    }

    (start, end, grid)
}
```

## Part 1

Because there is only one shortest route, all contestant would take it, making the race boring.

Contestants are allowed to cheat once.
For a distance of 2 they can turn off their collision detection, this can be done once per race.
They must be on an empty space again after that second step.

In other words, in a 2D-grid, the [manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) between the start and endpoint of their cheat must be 2.

It does not matter which route contestants take during a cheat, a cheat is only identified by its start and end position.

The question asks how many cheats would save at least 100 steps.

Some skeleton/pseudo-code I want to work towards:

```rust
let (start, end, grid) = parse(input);
let pairs = valid_cheats_as_point_pairs(grid);

pairs
  .map(|(p1, p2)| cost_savings(p1, p2))
  .filter(|savings| savings >= 100)
  .count()
```

In that skeleton, I never use the starting or ending points.

I need to build up a map of minimum costs to reach a location from the start,
then I can use that map to calculate how much would be saved at each step of the loop over `pairs` above.

### Helpers

The `Point` struct got some familiar methods on it, and a new one to calculate the Manhattan distance.

```rust
impl Point {
    fn new(row: i32, col: i32) -> Self {
        Self { row, col }
    }

    fn add(&self, other: &Self) -> Self {
        Self::new(self.row + other.row, self.col + other.col)
    }

    fn dirs() -> [Point; 4] {
        [
            // up
            Self::new(-1, 0),
            // right
            Self::new(0, 1),
            // down
            Self::new(1, 0),
            // left
            Self::new(0, -1),
        ]
    }

    fn neighbours(&self, grid: &HashMap<Point, Tile>) -> Vec<Self> {
        let mut neighbours = Vec::new();
        for dir in Self::dirs() {
            let next = self.add(&dir);
            if grid.contains_key(&next) {
                neighbours.push(next);
            }
        }
        neighbours
    }

    fn manhattan(&self, other: &Self) -> u32 {
        self.row.abs_diff(other.row) + self.col.abs_diff(other.col)
    }
}
```

Next up, building the map of minimum costs to reach a `Point` when starting from `start`.

That means that at the end of this helper, only reachable points will be in this map.

I use a familiar strategy here, [bfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) go BRRRRRRR.

```rust
fn build_distmap(grid: &HashMap<Point, Tile>, start: Point, end: Point) -> HashMap<Point, u32> {
    let mut q = VecDeque::new();
    let mut distmap = HashMap::new();

    q.push_back((start, 0));

    while let Some((pos, cost)) = q.pop_front() {
        // update map of lowest cost distances to a position
        if distmap.contains_key(&pos) {
            continue;
        }
        distmap.insert(pos, cost);
        // there is only one route, return the map of minimum distances
        if pos == end {
            return distmap;
        }
        for neighbour in pos.neighbours(grid) {
            if grid[&neighbour] != Tile::Wall {
                q.push_back((neighbour, cost + 1));
            }
        }
    }

    panic!("at the disco")
}
```

### Code

<Aside variant="info">

I used the [`tuple_combinations` method from `Itertools`](https://docs.rs/itertools/latest/itertools/trait.Itertools.html#method.tuple_combinations) to get all possible combinations between 2 points.

You can also get all combinations of 2 numbers from `0` to `N-1` like this:

```rust
for i in 0..N {
  for j in i + 1..N {
  }
}
```

</Aside>

```rust title=day_20.rs
fn part_1(input: &str) -> usize {
    let (start, end, grid) = parse(input);
    let distmap = build_distmap(&grid, start, end);
    distmap
        .iter()
        // get all possible 2 point pairs
        .tuple_combinations()
        .filter(|((p1, c1), (p2, &c2))| {
            // confirm a skip between the 2 points is possible
            if p1.manhattan(p2) == 2 {
                let saved = c1.abs_diff(c2) - 2;
                // confirm the savings after applying that skip would be large enough
                if saved >= 100 {
                    return true;
                }
            }
            false
        })
        .count()
}
```

## Part 2

Now the largest skipsize is 20.
It is allowed to be smaller.

That's a small change.

- Allow all skips with a distance smaller than 20.
- Subtract the distance of the skip from the difference in costs to get the savings.

```rust {8-10}
fn part_2(input: &str) -> usize {
    let (start, end, grid) = parse(input);
    let distmap = build_distmap(&grid, start, end);
    distmap
        .iter()
        .tuple_combinations()
        .filter(|((p1, c1), (p2, &c2))| {
            let skip_size = p1.manhattan(p2);
            if skip_size <= 20 {
                let saved = c1.abs_diff(c2) - skip_size;
                if saved >= 100 {
                    return true;
                }
            }
            false
        })
        .count()
}
```

## Final code

I abstracted the main logic into a function that takes the maximum length of a ship as a parameter.

```rust title=day_20.rs showLineNumbers
use itertools::Itertools;
use std::collections::{HashMap, VecDeque};

#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Clone, Copy)]
struct Point {
    row: i32,
    col: i32,
}

impl Point {
    fn new(row: i32, col: i32) -> Self {
        Self { row, col }
    }

    fn add(&self, other: &Self) -> Self {
        Self::new(self.row + other.row, self.col + other.col)
    }

    fn dirs() -> [Point; 4] {
        [
            // up
            Self::new(-1, 0),
            // right
            Self::new(0, 1),
            // down
            Self::new(1, 0),
            // left
            Self::new(0, -1),
        ]
    }

    fn neighbours(&self, grid: &HashMap<Point, Tile>) -> Vec<Self> {
        let mut neighbours = Vec::new();
        for dir in Self::dirs() {
            let next = self.add(&dir);
            if grid.contains_key(&next) {
                neighbours.push(next);
            }
        }
        neighbours
    }

    fn manhattan(&self, other: &Self) -> u32 {
        self.row.abs_diff(other.row) + self.col.abs_diff(other.col)
    }
}

#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Clone, Copy)]

    Empty,
    Wall,
}

fn parse(input: &str) -> (Point, Point, HashMap<Point, Tile>) {
    let mut start = Point::new(0, 0);
    let mut end = Point::new(0, 0);
    let mut grid = HashMap::new();

    for (row, line) in input.lines().enumerate() {
        for (col, c) in line.chars().enumerate() {
            let point = Point::new(row as i32, col as i32);
            let tile = match c {
                '.' => Tile::Empty,
                '#' => Tile::Wall,
                'S' => {
                    start.row = row as i32;
                    start.col = col as i32;
                    Tile::Empty
                }
                'E' => {
                    end.row = row as i32;

            };
            grid.insert(point, tile);
        }
    }

    (start, end, grid)
}

fn count(distmap: &HashMap<Point, u32>, max_skip: u32) -> usize {

        .filter(|((p1, c1), (p2, &c2))| {

            let skip_size = p1.manhattan(p2);
            if skip_size <= max_skip {
                let saved = c1.abs_diff(c2) - skip_size;
                // confirm the savings after applying that skip would be large enough
                if saved >= 100 {
