## Day 8: Haunted Wasteland

https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/8

<Aside>
TL;DR: [my solution in Rust](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/scrapyard/blob/main/advent_of_code/2023/solutions/src/day_08.rs)
</Aside>

You are still riding a camel on Desert Island.
A sandstorm is coming and you need to <abbr title="get out of there">make yourself scarce</abbr>, quickly.

Your guide just finished warning you about ghosts too, very spooky an not at all foreshadowing, nuh-uh.

Your puzzle input today is a piece of paper labeled "maps", you use those maps to get out of there.

The first line is a list of left/right instructions.

The following block are a bunch of `key = value` pairs where a value is written as `(left, right)`.

An example input looks like this:

```txt title=input.txt
RL

AAA = (BBB, CCC)
BBB = (DDD, EEE)
CCC = (ZZZ, GGG)
DDD = (DDD, DDD)
EEE = (EEE, EEE)
GGG = (GGG, GGG)
ZZZ = (ZZZ, ZZZ)
```

The first line in the input tells you to go right first, then left.

The letter combinations in the map are locations.
Each location leads to two other locations, one if you go left, and one if you go right.

## Part 1

You start at location `AAA` and want to go to location `ZZZ`.

If you follow the instructions over and over, you will get to `ZZZ` eventually.

The question asks how many steps it takes to get to `ZZZ` if you start at `AAA`.

I chose to parse the input into Rust `struct`s again.
The top line of the input turns into a list of `Instruction`.

```rust
enum Instruction {
    Left,
    Right,
}
```

The map in the input turns into a `HashMap` with a position as key, and a `Destinations` struct as value.

```rust
struct Destinations<'a> {
    left: &'a str,
    right: &'a str,
}
```

The actual logic for this part was straightforward.
I kept track of a `curr` variable that stores the location I'm currently at, it starts at `"AAA"`.

Then I loop until my current location is `"ZZZ"`.

For every iteration, I pull an instruction from the initial list of instructions I made repeat endlessly.
I apply that instruction and update the `step` count.

### Code

```rust title=day_08.rs
use std::collections::HashMap;

enum Instruction {
    Left,
    Right,
}

struct Destinations<'a> {
    left: &'a str,
    right: &'a str,
}

pub fn part_1(input: &str) -> u32 {
    let (instructions, map) = input.split_once("\n\n").unwrap();
    let instructions = instructions.chars().map(|c| match c {
        'L' => Instruction::Left,
        'R' => Instruction::Right,
        _ => panic!("at the disco"),
    });
    let map: HashMap<&str, Destinations> = map
        .lines()
        .map(|line| {
            let (source, destinations) = line.split_once(" = ").unwrap();
            let destinations = destinations
                .strip_prefix("(")
                .unwrap()
                .strip_suffix(")")
                .unwrap();
            let destinations = destinations.split_once(", ").unwrap();
            (
                source,
                Destinations {
                    left: destinations.0,
                    right: destinations.1,
                },
            )
        })
        .collect();

    let mut instructions = instructions.cycle();
    let mut steps = 0;
    let mut curr = "AAA";

    while curr != "ZZZ" {
        let ins = instructions.next().unwrap();
        let Destinations { left, right } = map.get(curr).unwrap();
        curr = match ins {
            Instruction::Left => left,
            Instruction::Right => right,
        };
        steps += 1;
    }

    steps
}
```

## Part 2

The map isn't for people, it's for ghosts!

The number of nodes with names ending in A is equal to the number ending in Z!

If you were a ghost, you would start at all nodes ending with an A simultaneously and follow each path until **they all end in a Z at the same time**.

- Each ghost has a different starting point
- Each ghost follows the same instruction

In the example:
```txt title=input.txt
LR

11A = (11B, XXX)
11B = (XXX, 11Z)
11Z = (11B, XXX)
22A = (22B, XXX)
22B = (22C, 22C)
22C = (22Z, 22Z)
22Z = (22B, 22B)
XXX = (XXX, XXX)
```

There are 2 ghosts:
1. Starts at `11A`
2. Starts at `22A`

Following the instructions until all ghosts end up at a location ending in `Z`:
- Step 0: You are at 11A and 22A.
- Step 1: You choose all of the left paths, leading you to 11B and 22B.
- Step 2: You choose all of the right paths, leading you to 11Z and 22C.
- Step 3: You choose all of the left paths, leading you to 11B and 22Z.
- Step 4: You choose all of the right paths, leading you to 11Z and 22B.
- Step 5: You choose all of the left paths, leading you to 11B and 22C.
- Step 6: You choose all of the right paths, leading you to 11Z and 22Z.

The question asks how many steps it takes before all ghosts are on nodes that end with Z?

I attempted to use the same code as in part1, and slightly modify it, but alas.
Today is a day that is not going to be solved by brute-force in any reasonable time.

It turns out today's input is specially crafted.
The guiding text gives us some hints, but the specifics remain for us to discover (or, if you're like me, look up).

It looks like part2 is the traditional cycle detection problem! Advent of Code has one every year. (or most years anyway)

Like [AoC 2022 day 17](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/17) part 2, which I also [have a blogpost on](https://nickymeuleman.netlify.app/garden/aoc2022-day17#part-2)
Or [AoC 2017 day 16](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/16) part 2, [my solution code](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/scrapyard/blob/84a9f5e72474179f46827bd263bcd00ba0abe8e7/advent_of_code/2017/solutions/src/day_16.rs#L107)

Back to how the input is special, and how you can use that fact.

The first clue is in the guiding text:
> After examining the maps a bit longer, your attention is drawn to a curious fact: the number of nodes with names ending in A is equal to the number ending in Z!

The number of steps it takes for a ghost to get to the end is a clean multiple of the instruction length for every ghost.

Each ghost has a seperate ending point, and never visits other ending points.

All ghosts loop back around to their starting point, and then to their starting point, and then their ending point, until infinity.

Every last location leads to the second location that ghost ever visited.
That means every loop a ghost does is identical in length.

tl;dr: Every ghost is on their own loop, they go round, and round, eventually all standing on a location that ends in a Z.

All this put together means that, for every ghost you figure out how long it takes until they reach their ending location.
A time where all ghosts are at their ending location at the same time is the [least common multiple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znmPfDfsir8) of all those numbers.

To find that, I first found the [greatest common divisor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFd-6EPfnec) using [the Euclidian algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm)

In code, I kept track of how many full instruction lines were executed.

Every time I execute a full set of instructions (the first line of the input without repeating),
I check if any ghosts are at their ending, and keep track of how many sets of instructions it took.
