## Day 12: Garden Groups

https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/12

<Aside>
  TL;DR: [my solution in
  Rust](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/scrapyard/blob/main/advent_of_code/2024/solutions/src/day_12.rs)
</Aside>

Another day, another [familiar location](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/21).

Today's input is the layout of the huge garden plot you are at.

An example input looks like this:

```txt title=input.txt
RRRRIICCFF
RRRRIICCCF
VVRRRCCFFF
VVRCCCJFFF
VVVVCJJCFE
VVIVCCJJEE
VVIIICJJEE
MIIIIIJJEE
MIIISIJEEE
MMMISSJEEE
```

It's a 2D-grid again where each letter signals a type of crop that grows in that location.

## Parsing

If you've been following along, you know what I do when I see a grid puzzle by now, `Point`!

### `Point`

```rust
#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Clone, Copy)]
struct Point {
    row: i32,
    col: i32,
}

impl Point {
    fn new(row: i32, col: i32) -> Self {
        Self { row, col }
    }
}
```

---

I stored each letter in a map again.
This is not the most efficient way to store this, but it's very nice to work with and think about.

```rust
fn parse(input: &str) -> HashMap<Point, char> {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    for (row, line) in input.lines().enumerate() {
        for (col, c) in line.chars().enumerate() {
            let point = Point::new(row as i32, col as i32);
            map.insert(point, c);
        }
    }
    map
}
```

## Part 1

The elves want to put up fences around regions of plots that grow the same crop.
A plot that touches another plot (up/right/down/left) that grows the same crop belongs to the same region.

You need to figure out each plot's **area** and **perimeter**.
The price for an amount of fence is `area * perimeter`.
Don't ask why, the answer is ✨reasons✨.

The question asks for the sum of all region prices.

Some skeleton/pseudo-code

```rust
let map = parse(input);
let mut sum = 0;
for (point, crop) in &map {
  // ignore points that are already contributing to the sum
  let shape = shape(point, crop);
  let area = area(shape);
  let circumference = circumference(shape);
  sum += area * circumference;
}
sum
```

### Helpers

Time to write the code that can make my skeleton-code a reality.

```rust
#[derive(PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Clone, Copy)]
struct Point {
    row: i32,
    col: i32,
}

impl Point {
    fn new(row: i32, col: i32) -> Self {
        Self { row, col }
    }

    fn add(&self, other: &Self) -> Self {
        Self::new(self.row + other.row, self.col + other.col)
    }

    fn same_neighbours(&self, map: &HashMap<Point, char>, target_crop: char) -> Vec<Self> {
        let mut neighbours = Vec::new();
        for dir in Self::dirs() {
            let next = self.add(&dir);
            if map.get(&next).is_some_and(|&crop| crop == target_crop) {
                neighbours.push(next);
            }
        }
        neighbours
    }

    fn dirs() -> [Point; 4] {
        [
            // up
            Self::new(-1, 0),
            // right
            Self::new(0, 1),
            // down
            Self::new(1, 0),
            // left
            Self::new(0, -1),
        ]
    }
}

fn shape(
    start: Point,
    crop: char,
    map: &HashMap<Point, char>,
    seen: &mut HashSet<Point>,
) -> HashSet<Point> {
    let mut q = VecDeque::new();
    let mut shape = HashSet::new();
    q.push_back(start);
    shape.insert(start);

    while let Some(point) = q.pop_front() {
        for neighbour in point.same_neighbours(map, crop) {
            if seen.insert(neighbour) {
                shape.insert(neighbour);
                q.push_back(neighbour);
            }
        }
    }

    shape
}

fn circumference(map: &HashMap<Point, char>, shape: &HashSet<Point>) -> usize {
    shape
        .iter()
        .map(|point| 4 - point.same_neighbours(map, map[point]).len())
        .sum()
}
```

### Code

A global set makes sure I don't count garden plots that already contribute to the sum twice.
Each time a shape (a set of `Point`s) is calculated,
those `Point`s are added to the set so they can't be included in future shapes.

You might have noticed the distinct lack of `area()`,
well, that's a oneliner and making a function for it would be a bit silly.

```rust title=day_12.rs
fn part_1(input: &str) -> usize {
    let map = parse(input);
    let mut seen = HashSet::new();
    let mut sum = 0;
    for (point, crop) in &map {
        if seen.contains(point) {
            continue;
        }
        let shape = shape(*point, *crop, &map, &mut seen);
        let area = shape.len();
        let circumference = circumference(&map, &shape);
        sum += area * circumference;
    }
    sum
}
```

## Part 2

Instead of the circumference of garden plots, use the amount of sides the plot has.

The question asks for the sum of all region prices again.

Some skeleton/pseudo-code again, changing `circumference` to `sides`:

```rust {7-8}
let map = parse(input);
let mut sum = 0;
for (point, crop) in &map {
  // ignore points that are already contributing to the sum
  let shape = shape(point, crop);
  let area = area(shape);
  let sides = sides(shape);
  sum += area * sides;
}
sum
```

### Helpers

Updating the helpers from part 1.
The most interesting is the `sides` function, which I adapted from solutions I saw only.
It chooses a direction, goes in it until the garden plot ends, and then follows the side in the perpendicular direction until that ends.

```rust title=day_12.rs
impl Point {
    // -- snip --
    fn perp(&self) -> Self {
        // turn and face a perpendicular direction
        // does not matter if (row, col) turns into (-col, row) or (col, row) for this algorithm
        Point::new(-self.col, self.row)
    }
}

fn sides(shape: HashSet<Point>) -> usize {
    let mut sides = HashSet::new();
    for point in &shape {
        for dir in Point::dirs() {
            // look for first out of bounds element in dir
            if shape.contains(&point.add(&dir)) {
                continue;
            }
            // perpendicular dir
            let perp = dir.perp();
            let mut curr = *point;

            // keep moving in the perpendicular direction while:
            // - a block in the perpendicular direction exists
            // - a block in the original direction doesn't exist
            while shape.contains(&curr.add(&perp)) && !shape.contains(&curr.add(&dir)) {
                curr = curr.add(&perp);
            }
            // when edge was followed, add this (point, dir) to the sides.
            // include dir because 1 point has 4 sides
            sides.insert((curr, dir));
        }
    }
    sides.len()
}
```

### Code

```rust
fn part_2(input: &str) -> usize {
    let map = parse(input);
    let mut seen = HashSet::new();
    let mut sum = 0;
    for (point, crop) in &map {
        if seen.contains(point) {
            continue;
        }
        let shape = shape(*point, *crop, &map, &mut seen);
        let area = shape.len();
        let sides = sides(shape);
        sum += area * sides;
    }
    sum
}
```
