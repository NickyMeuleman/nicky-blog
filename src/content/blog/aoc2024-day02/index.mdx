## Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports

https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2

<Aside>
  TL;DR: [my solution in
  Rust](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/scrapyard/blob/main/advent_of_code/2024/solutions/src/day_02.rs)
</Aside>

Today's location to search for the chief historian is familiar.
You [remember visiting it](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/19), in the before times (of 2015).

The elves in charge of the place ask you to help with some weird report data the reactor spit out.
That's your input, a list of reports, one per line.
Each report is a bunch of numbers separated by spaces.

An example input looks like this:

```txt title=input.txt
7 6 4 2 1
1 2 7 8 9
9 7 6 2 1
1 3 2 4 5
8 6 4 4 1
1 3 6 7 9
```

## Parsing

Today, I chose to make a function to parse a single line into a list of numbers.
Why not the entire input? Because I wrote it like this first, and this is fine.

```rust
fn parse_line(line: &str) -> Vec<i32> {
    line.split_whitespace()
        .map(|s| s.parse().unwrap())
        .collect()
}
```

## Part 1

You need to determine if a report is safe.

A report is safe if:

1. All levels are increasing or they are all decreasing
1. Any two adjacent levels differ by at least 1 and at most 3

I wrote two solutions, one with good ol' `for` loops, and one focussing on using iterators.

Both solutions use a helper method called `is_safe` that takes in a report and returns a boolean.
For both solutions I used [`itertools`](https://docs.rs/itertools/latest/itertools/) to help iterate over a sliding window of size 2.

The question asks how many reports are safe.

### Helper

#### Option 1: Loopin' with `for`

```rust
fn is_safe(report: &[i32]) -> bool {
    let dir = (report[0] - report[1]).signum();
    for (a, b) in report.iter().tuple_windows() {
        let diff = a - b;
        if diff == 0 || diff.abs() > 3 || diff.signum() != dir {
            return false;
        }
    }
    true
}
```

#### Option 2: Iterators

```rust
fn is_safe(report: &[i32]) -> bool {
    let dir = (report[0] - report[1]).signum();
    report.iter().tuple_windows().all(|(&a, &b)| {
        let diff = a - b;
        diff != 0 && diff.abs() <= 3 && diff.signum() == dir
    })
}
```

### Option 1: Loopin' with `for`

```rust title=day_02.rs
pub fn part_1(input: &str) -> usize {
    let mut count = 0;
    for line in input.lines() {
        let report = parse_line(line);
        if is_safe(&report) {
            count += 1;
        }
    }
    count
}
```

### Option 2: Iterators

```rust title=day_02.rs
pub fn part_1(input: &str) -> usize {
    input
        .lines()
        .map(parse_line)
        .filter(|report| is_safe(report))
        .count()
}
```

## Part 2

Turns out the reactor can handle one bad level.
If it sees a bad level for the first time, it pretends nothing happened.

Do the same sum, but count reports that have a single bad value as well.

Same thing here, I coded 2 solutions.

The question asks how many reports are safe.

### Helper

The helper for part2 uses the helper for part1.
Aaaaaaah, _code reuse_.

It loops over each report, deleting one value at a time.
If it finds a safe report (with a deleted value), the report is deemed safe.

It's brute-force, but no worries, computer goes BRRRRRRRRRRR after all.

#### Option 1: Loopin' with `for`

```rust
fn is_safe_p2(report: &[i32]) -> bool {
    for idx in 0..report.len() {
        let mut report = report.to_vec();
        report.remove(idx);
        if is_safe(&report) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    false
}
```

#### Option 2: Iterators

```rust
fn is_safe_p2(report: &[i32]) -> bool {
    (0..report.len()).any(|idx| {
        let mut report = report.to_vec();
        report.remove(idx);
        is_safe_iter(&report)
    })
}
```

### Option 1: Loopin' with `for`

```rust title=day_02.rs
fn part_2(input: &str) -> usize {
    let mut count = 0;
    for line in input.lines() {
        let report = parse_line(line);
        if is_safe_p2(&report) {
            count += 1;
        }
    }
    count
}
```

### Option 2: Iterators

```rust title=day_01.rs
fn part_2(input: &str) -> usize {
    input
        .lines()
        .map(parse_line)
        .filter(|report| is_safe_p2(report))
        .count()
}
```

## Final code

```rust title=day_02.rs showLineNumbers
use itertools::Itertools;

fn parse_line(line: &str) -> Vec<i32> {
    line.split_whitespace()
        .map(|s| s.parse().unwrap())
        .collect()
}

fn is_safe(report: &[i32]) -> bool {
    let dir = (report[0] - report[1]).signum();
    report.iter().tuple_windows().all(|(&a, &b)| {
        let diff = a - b;
        diff != 0 && diff.abs() <= 3 && diff.signum() == dir
    })
}

fn part_1(input: &str) -> usize {
    input
        .lines()
        .map(parse_line)
        .filter(|report| is_safe(report))
        .count()
}

fn is_safe_p2(report: &[i32]) -> bool {
    if is_safe_iter(report) {
        return true;
    }
    (0..report.len()).any(|idx| {
        let mut report = report.to_vec();
        report.remove(idx);
        is_safe(&report)
    })
}

fn part_2(input: &str) -> usize {
    input
        .lines()
        .map(parse_line)
        .filter(|report| is_safe_p2(report))
        .count()
}
```
