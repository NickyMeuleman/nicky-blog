## Day 4: Ceres Search

https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/4

<Aside>
  TL;DR: [my solution in
  Rust](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/scrapyard/blob/main/advent_of_code/2024/solutions/src/day_04.rs)
</Aside>

Today's location to search for the chief historian is familiar (Again! Makes sense, you've been to many interesting places.).
You [remember visiting it](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/10).

As is tradition, the an elf there asks for your help with something.

With a word search puzzle!

That's your input, the puzzle.

An example input looks like this:

```txt title=input.txt
MMMSXXMASM
MSAMXMSMSA
AMXSXMAAMM
MSAMASMSMX
XMASAMXAMM
XXAMMXXAMA
SMSMSASXSS
SAXAMASAAA
MAMMMXMMMM
MXMXAXMASX
```

You can form words in all 8 directions, horizontals, verticals, and diagonals.
Words can overlap.

## Part 1

You might have already guessed by looking at the example input, the word you have to search for is "XMAS".

The question asks how many times "XMAS" appears in the puzzle.
Remember overlapping letters is allowed!

I coded two option per part again.
A good ol reliable `for` loop, and a fancy-schmancy iterator chain.

In both methods, I look for an "X" first.
Then look in all directions, and if I find "MAS", I increment the counter.

This brings out my love-hate relationship with number data types that can't become negative.
On one hand, they prevent so many issue, but on the other LET ME CALCULATE OFFSETS IN PEACE.

The iterator example is commented better, so if you want an idea of which steps are executed, it might be better to look at that first.

### A teeny tiny lil helping constant

I chose to represent the directions in a list of offsets.
Each item in the list is what should happen to the row and column indices to take a step in that direction.

```rust
// up, up-right, right, down-right, down, down-left, left, up-left
const DIRS: [(i32, i32); 8] = [
    (-1, 0),
    (-1, 1),
    (0, 1),
    (1, 1),
    (1, 0),
    (1, -1),
    (0, -1),
    (-1, -1),
];
```

### Option 1: `for` loop

```rust title=day_04.rs
fn part_1(input: &str) -> usize {
    let grid: Vec<_> = input.lines().map(|line| line.as_bytes()).collect();
    let mut count = 0;
    for r in 0..grid.len() {
        for c in 0..grid[0].len() {
            if grid[r][c] != b'X' {
                continue;
            }
            let r = r as i32;
            let c = c as i32;
            for (dr, dc) in DIRS {
                // bounds check (last char has to be inside the grid)
                let final_r = r + dr * 3;
                let final_c = c + dc * 3;
                if final_r < 0
                    || final_c < 0
                    || final_r >= grid.len() as i32
                    || final_c >= grid[0].len() as i32
                {
                    continue;
                }

                if &[
                    grid[(r + dr) as usize][(c + dc) as usize],
                    grid[(r + dr * 2) as usize][(c + dc * 2) as usize],
                    grid[(r + dr * 3) as usize][(c + dc * 3) as usize],
                ] == b"MAS"
                {
                    count += 1;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    count
}
```

### Option 2: Iterator chain

```rust title=day_04.rs
pub fn part_1(input: &str) -> usize {
    let grid: Vec<_> = input.lines().map(|line| line.as_bytes()).collect();
    (0..grid.len())
        // turn into iterator over (row_idx, col_idx)
        .flat_map(|r| (0..grid[0].len()).map(move |c| (r, c)))
        // first char must be X
        .filter(|(r, c)| grid[*r][*c] == b'X')
        // map into indexes in one direction
        .flat_map(|(r, c)| {
            DIRS.iter().map(move |(dr, dc)| {
                [
                    (r as i32 + dr, c as i32 + dc),
                    (r as i32 + 2 * dr, c as i32 + 2 * dc),
                    (r as i32 + 3 * dr, c as i32 + 3 * dc),
                ]
            })
        })
        // bounds check the last letter
        .filter(|&[_, _, (r, c)]| {
            (r >= 0 && r < grid.len() as i32) && (c >= 0 && c < grid[0].len() as i32)
        })
        // turn indexes back into usizes
        .map(|[(r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3)]| {
            [
                (r1 as usize, c1 as usize),
                (r2 as usize, c2 as usize),
                (r3 as usize, c3 as usize),
            ]
        })
        // turn idxes into letters
        .map(|[(r1, c1), (r2, c2), (r3, c3)]| [grid[r1][c1], grid[r2][c2], grid[r3][c3]])
        // check if word spells MAS
        .filter(|word| word == b"MAS")
        .count()
}
```

## Part 2

You misunderstood, this isn't an "XMAS" puzzle, it's an X-"MAS" puzzle.

You are supposed to count the amount of times "MAS" appears in an X pattern, like this:

```text
M.S
.A.
M.S
```

The dots here are characters that are irrelevant.

The question asks how many times "MAS" appears in an X pattern in the puzzle.

For this part, I start by looking for an "A".
Then I note the 4 adjacent corner letters.

If they are in a valid order, I increment the count.

The iterator chain example is commented better again.

### Option 1: `for` loop

```rust title=day_04.rs
fn part_2(input: &str) -> usize {
    let grid: Vec<_> = input.lines().map(|line| line.as_bytes()).collect();
    let mut count = 0;
    for r in 1..grid.len() - 1 {
        for c in 1..grid[0].len() - 1 {
            if grid[r][c] != b'A' {
                continue;
            }
            let circle = [
                grid[r - 1][c - 1],
                grid[r - 1][c + 1],
                grid[r + 1][c + 1],
                grid[r + 1][c - 1],
            ];
            if &circle == b"MSSM" || &circle == b"MMSS" || &circle == b"SMMS" || &circle == b"SSMM"
            {
                count += 1;
            }
        }
    }
    count
}
```

### Option 2: Iterator chain

```rust title=day_04.rs
fn part_2(input: &str) -> usize {
    let grid: Vec<_> = input.lines().map(|line| line.as_bytes()).collect();
    (1..grid.len() - 1)
        // turn into iterator over (row_idx, col_idx)
        .flat_map(|r| (1..grid[0].len() - 1).map(move |c| (r, c)))
        // middle char must be A
        .filter(|(r, c)| grid[*r][*c] == b'A')
        // turn into up-left, up-right, down-right, down-left
        .map(|(r, c)| {
            [
                grid[r - 1][c - 1],
                grid[r - 1][c + 1],
                grid[r + 1][c + 1],
                grid[r + 1][c - 1],
            ]
        })
        // only accept valid circles
        .filter(|circle| {
            circle == b"MSSM" || circle == b"MMSS" || circle == b"SMMS" || circle == b"SSMM"
        })
        .count()
}
```

## Final code

Linelength, nice.
