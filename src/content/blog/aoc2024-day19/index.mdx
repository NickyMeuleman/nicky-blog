## Day 19: Linen Layout

https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/19

<Aside>
  TL;DR: [my solution in
  Rust](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/scrapyard/blob/main/advent_of_code/2024/solutions/src/day_19.rs)
</Aside>

You are at a spa and have to arrange a bunch of towels into patterns.

An example input looks like this:

```txt title=input.txt
r, wr, b, g, bwu, rb, gb, br

brwrr
bggr
gbbr
rrbgbr
ubwu
bwurrg
brgr
bbrgwb
```

The top section is a list of available towel types,
the bottom section is a list of patterns to make with those towels.

For each towel type, the spa has infinitely many of them, they want to know if it's possible to combine them in ways that make a certain pattern.

What the letters in the input mean is not really important, but here goes anyway:
each letter in a towel represents a coloured stripe.
The patterns have a bunch of coloured stripes in a specific order.

Flipping a towel to get its pattern in reverse in not allowed.

## Parsing

Making 2 lists of strings.

```rust
fn parse(input: &str) -> (Vec<&str>, Vec<&str>) {
    let (towels, patterns) = input.split_once("\n\n").unwrap();
    let towels = towels.split(", ").collect();
    let patterns = patterns.lines().collect();
    (towels, patterns)
}
```

## Part 1

The question asks how many patterns are possible to make given the available towel types.

Yay, this is a recursive function!

Count the amount of ways a pattern can be made, inside the function that does that count the amount of ways a smaller pattern can be made.

<Aside variant="success">
  This is a day where I did something I shouldn't have, I speculated on what
  part2 might be, and coded part1 with that in mind. It ended up working out
  today, but it rarely does!
</Aside>

First some skeleton/pseudo-code for the thing I want to code towards.

```rust
pub fn part_1(input: &str) -> usize {
    let (towels, patterns) = parse(input);

    patterns
        .into_iter()
        .filter(|pattern| count_sequences(pattern, &towels) != 0)
        .count()
}
```

### Helpers

The recursive function.

It takes a pattern I want to make, and a set of available towel types.
For each available type of towel, I check if the wanted pattern starts with the stripes on that towel.
If it does, I use that same function to count how many ways there are to make the pattern with that towel cut off from the start of the pattern.
I then return the sum of all those ways.

The base case for my resursion is when the pattern is empty, because then we successfully cut off a bunch of towels that make the original pattern.

```rust
fn count_sequences(pattern: &str, towels: &[&str]) -> u64 {
    if pattern.is_empty() {
        return 1;
    }

    towels
        .iter()
        .filter(|&towel| pattern.starts_with(towel))
        .map(|towel| count_sequences(&pattern[towel.len()..], towels))
        .sum()
}
```

### Code

Now, that code is correct, but slow.
It recomputes the same thing over and over.

So I remember previous work and store it in a cache.

Feeding that cache into my recursive function and BAM, I just did some **dynamic programming**.

```rust title=day_19.rs
fn count_sequences<'a>(
    pattern: &'a str,
    towels: &[&str],
    cache: &mut HashMap<&'a str, u64>,
) -> u64 {
    if pattern.is_empty() {
        return 1;
    }
    if let Some(&num) = cache.get(&pattern) {
        return num;
    }

    let sum = towels
        .iter()
        .filter(|&towel| pattern.starts_with(towel))
        .map(|towel| count_sequences(&pattern[towel.len()..], towels, cache))
        .sum();
    cache.insert(pattern, sum);

    sum
}

pub fn part_1(input: &str) -> usize {
    let (towels, patterns) = parse(input);
    let mut cache = HashMap::new();

    patterns
        .into_iter()
        .filter(|pattern| count_sequences(pattern, &towels, &mut cache) != 0)
        .count()
}
```

## Part 2

The question asks for the sum of the amount of ways the patterns can be made.

My part1 paid off, and part2 is a tiny change now!

```rust
pub fn part_2(input: &str) -> u64 {
    let (towels, patterns) = parse(input);
    let mut cache = HashMap::new();

    patterns
        .into_iter()
        .map(|pattern| count_sequences(pattern, &towels, &mut cache))
        .sum()
}
```

## Final code

```rust title=day_19.rs showLineNumbers
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn count_sequences<'a>(
    pattern: &'a str,
    towels: &[&str],
    cache: &mut HashMap<&'a str, u64>,
) -> u64 {
    if pattern.is_empty() {
        return 1;
    }
    if let Some(&num) = cache.get(&pattern) {
        return num;
    }

    let sum = towels
        .iter()
        .filter(|&towel| pattern.starts_with(towel))
        .map(|towel| count_sequences(&pattern[towel.len()..], towels, cache))
        .sum();
    cache.insert(pattern, sum);

    sum
}

fn parse(input: &str) -> (Vec<&str>, Vec<&str>) {
    let (towels, patterns) = input.split_once("\n\n").unwrap();
    let towels = towels.split(", ").collect();
    let patterns = patterns.lines().collect();
    (towels, patterns)
}

fn part_1(input: &str) -> usize {
    let (towels, patterns) = parse(input);
    let mut cache = HashMap::new();

    patterns
        .into_iter()
        .filter(|pattern| count_sequences(pattern, &towels, &mut cache) != 0)
        .count()
}

fn part_2(input: &str) -> u64 {
    let (towels, patterns) = parse(input);
    let mut cache = HashMap::new();

    patterns
        .into_iter()
        .map(|pattern| count_sequences(pattern, &towels, &mut cache))
        .sum()
}
```
