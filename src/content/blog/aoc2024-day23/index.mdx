## Day 23: LAN Party

https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/23

<Aside>
  TL;DR: [my solution in
  Rust](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/scrapyard/blob/main/advent_of_code/2024/solutions/src/day_23.rs)
</Aside>

You are at the Easter bunny HQ again, they are holding a LAN party.
You [download](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/9) a map of their network, that's your input.

An example input looks like this:

```txt title=input.txt
kh-tc
qp-kh
de-cg
ka-co
yn-aq
qp-ub
cg-tb
vc-aq
tb-ka
wh-tc
yn-cg
kh-ub
ta-co
de-co
tc-td
tb-wq
wh-td
ta-ka
td-qp
aq-cg
wq-ub
ub-vc
de-ta
wq-aq
wq-vc
wh-yn
ka-de
kh-ta
co-tc
wh-qp
tb-vc
td-yn
```

Each line describes a connection between two computer names.
The connections don't have a direction, so the first line means:

1. `kh` connects to `tc`
1. `tc` connects to `kh`

In other words, the network is a graph with a bunch of undirected edges.
Get ready for a graph theory problem!

### Parsing

Creating the graph.

```rust
fn parse(input: &str) -> HashMap<&str, HashSet<&str>> {
    let mut connections: HashMap<&str, HashSet<&str>> = HashMap::new();
    for line in input.lines() {
        let (left, right) = line.split_once('-').unwrap();
        connections.entry(left).or_default().insert(right);
        connections.entry(right).or_default().insert(left);
    }
    connections
}
```

## Part 1

The chief historian might be participating, their computer name starts with a `t`.
Start by looking for sets of 3 computers that are all connected to each other where at least 1 name starts with a `t`.

The question asks how many [cliques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_(graph_theory)) of 3 contain a computer that starts with a `t`.

```rust title=day_23.rs
fn part_1(input: &str) -> usize {
    let connections = parse(input);
    let mut sets = HashSet::new();
    for pc1 in connections.keys() {
        // only count sets where first pc might be the chief historian's to avoid triplecounting
        if !pc1.starts_with('t') {
            continue;
        }
        // pcs connected to pc1
        for pc2 in &connections[pc1] {
            // pcs connected to both pc1 and pc2
            for pc3 in connections[pc1].intersection(&connections[pc2]) {
                let set = BTreeSet::from([pc1, pc2, pc3]);
                sets.insert(set);
            }
        }
    }

    sets.len()
}
```

## Part 2

Now find the largest clique in the graph.

The password is the alphbetically sorted names of all computers in the LAN party.

The question asks what the password is.

During my initial solve, I used a method that gave me the right answer, but turns out to be technically incorrect because it relies on the graph structure.
The input happened to be constructed in a way that made my code work (and as far as I can tell, works on everyones input).

I'll list it here too, but first, the way I should have done it.
There exists an algorithm for finding the largest clique in a graph with undirected edges: [the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bron%E2%80%93Kerbosch_algorithm).

I dislike 1 letter variable names, so I gave them a more descriptive name.
The comment above the helper is from wikipedia.

```rust title=day_23.rs
// More generally, given three disjoint sets of vertices R (all), P (some), and X (none)
// it finds the maximal cliques that include all of the vertices in R
// some of the vertices in P
// and none of the vertices in X.
fn bron_kerbosch<'a>(
    graph: &HashMap<&'a str, HashSet<&'a str>>,
    all: HashSet<&'a str>,
    mut some: HashSet<&'a str>,
    mut none: HashSet<&'a str>,
    cliques: &mut Vec<HashSet<&'a str>>,
) {
    if some.is_empty() {
        if none.is_empty() {
            cliques.push(all);
        }
        return;
    }

    for node in some.clone() {
        let neighbours = &graph[node];
        // nodes both in neighbours and in some
        let new_some = some.intersection(neighbours).copied().collect();
        // nodes both in neighbours and none
        let new_none = none.intersection(neighbours).copied().collect();
        // add neighbour to all
        let mut new_all = all.clone();
        new_all.insert(node);

        bron_kerbosch(graph, new_all, new_some, new_none, cliques);

        // prepare for next iteration: move considered node from some to none
        some.remove(node);
        none.insert(node);
    }
}

pub fn part_2(input: &str) -> String {
    let connections = parse(input);
    let mut cliques = Vec::new();
    let pcs = connections.keys().copied().collect();

    bron_kerbosch(
        &connections,
        &mut HashSet::new(),
        pcs,
        HashSet::new(),
        &mut cliques,
    );

    let mut clique: Vec<_> = cliques
        .into_iter()
        .max_by_key(|clique| clique.len())
        .unwrap()
        .into_iter()
        .collect();
    clique.sort();
    clique.join(",")
}
```

### Bonus: faster, but maybe incomplete

My original code, it works, but only because the input is crafted for it to work.

```rust
fn part_2(input: &str) -> String {
    let mut largest = HashSet::new();

    for (&name, neighbours) in &connections {
        let mut group = HashSet::new();
        group.insert(name);

        for &neighbour in neighbours {
            // if neighbour is connected to all group members, it joins the group
            let new_neighbours = connections.get(neighbour).unwrap();
            if group.is_subset(new_neighbours) {
                group.insert(neighbour);
            }
        }

        if group.len() > largest.len() {
            largest = group;
        }
    }

    let mut names: Vec<_> = largest.into_iter().collect();
    names.sort();
    names.join(",")
}
```
