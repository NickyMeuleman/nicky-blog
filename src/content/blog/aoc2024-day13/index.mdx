## Day 13: Claw Contraption

https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/13

<Aside>
  TL;DR: [my solution in
  Rust](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/scrapyard/blob/main/advent_of_code/2024/solutions/src/day_13.rs)
</Aside>

Another day, another [familiar location](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/24).

Today's input is the behaviour of a bunch of [arcade claw machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claw_machine).

An example input looks like this:

```txt title=input.txt
Button A: X+94, Y+34
Button B: X+22, Y+67
Prize: X=8400, Y=5400

Button A: X+26, Y+66
Button B: X+67, Y+21
Prize: X=12748, Y=12176

Button A: X+17, Y+86
Button B: X+84, Y+37
Prize: X=7870, Y=6450

Button A: X+69, Y+23
Button B: X+27, Y+71
Prize: X=18641, Y=10279
```

Each block of input represents one machine.
Their grippers all move on a 2D-plane directly above the prize.

Each machine has 2 buttons, which each move the gripper some direction in the `x` and `y` axis.

The 3 lines per machine tell you:

1. What pressing A does to the gripper coordinates
1. What pressing B does to the gripper coordinates
1. The coordinates of the prize

The goal is to place the gripper directly over the prize.
You do this by pressing the A and B button a number of times.

  Not every machine has a winnable combination, sometimes there is no possible
  way to win!

## Parsing

If you've been following along, you know what I do when I see a puzzle with coordinates by now, `Point`!

### `Point`

```rust
#[derive(PartialEq, Eq)]
struct Point {
    x: i64,
    y: i64,
}

impl Point {
    fn new(x: i64, y: i64) -> Self {
        Self { x, y }
    }
}
```

I stored each machine as a 3-item array of `Point`s.

```rust
use itertools::Itertools;

fn parse(input: &str) -> Vec<[Point; 3]> {
    let mut machines = Vec::new();
    for block in input.split("\n\n") {
        let (adx, ady, bdx, bdy, x, y) = block
            .split(|c: char| !c.is_ascii_digit())
            .filter(|s| !s.is_empty())
            .map(|s| s.parse().unwrap())
            .collect_tuple()
            .unwrap();
        let a = Point::new(adx, ady);
        let b = Point::new(bdx, bdy);
        let prize = Point::new(x, y);
        machines.push([a, b, prize]);
    }
    machines
}
```

## Part 1

- Pressing the A button costs 3 tokens.
- Pressing the B button costs 1 token.

Don't overthink why, the answer is ✨reasons✨.

The question asks for sum of the lowest cost for all winnable machines.

This is a system of 2 linear equations.

Variable definitions:

- $a_n$ The amount of times button A is pressed
- $b_n$ The amount of times button B is pressed
- $a_x$ The change in `x` coordinate pressing A causes
- $a_y$ The change in `y` coordinate pressing A causes
- $b_x$ The change in `x` coordinate pressing B causes
- $b_y$ The change in `y` coordinate pressing B causes
- $p_x$ The `x` coordinate of the prize
- $p_y$ The `y` coordinate of the prize

The 2 equations describe which `x` and `y` coordinate the gripper has after `n` presses.
This location should be equal to the location of the prize to win:

1. $a_n * a_x + b_n * b_x = p_x$
1. $a_n * a_y + b_n * b_y = p_y$

Solving for $a_n$ first.
By multiplying both sides of each equation so the $b_n$ term cancels out when I subtract the 2 equations from eachother:

1. the top is multiplied by $b_y$
1. the bottom is multiplied by $b_x$

$$
\begin{align*}
  & & a_n*a_x*b_y &+ b_n*b_x*b_y &=& ~p_x*b_y \\
\text{--} & & a_n*a_y*b_x &+ b_n*b_y*b_x &=& ~p_y*b_x \\
\hline
  & & a_n * (a_x * b_y - a_y * b_x) &+ 0 &=& ~p_x*b_y - p_y*b_x
\end{align*}
$$

Isolating $a_n$ as that is the only unknown, all other variables can be replaced by numbers.

$$
a_n = \frac{p_x*b_y - p_y*b_x}{a_x * b_y - a_y * b_x}
$$

After calculating the amount of times A should be pressed, calculate the amount of times B should be pressed.
I did this by replacing $a_n$ by its value in one of the original functions.

$$
b_n = \frac{p_x - a_n * a_x}{b_x}
$$

Now that we have the amount of times to press the A button and the amount of times to press the B button, we need to check if those numbers make sense.
After all, when dealing with 2 linear equations there are 3 possibilities:

1. They intersect once
1. They are parallel and never intersect
1. They represent the same line, overlap, so intersect infinitely many times

Luckily, this question never runs in to option 2 or 3.
Because the puzzlemaster decided to be kind today.

But there is still an extra option I have to handle, I'm not magic and can not press a button a fractional amount of times. (bummer, I know)

So in the code, I check if the position the gripper reaches after $a_n$ A presses and $b_n$ B presses is the same as the position of the prize.

If it is, I return a successful result with a price of $3 * a_n + 1 * b_n$.

<Aside variant="info">
  I'm not working with floating point numbers in my code. If a final variable is
  not an integer, the final check will fail, so this works out well even without
  working with floating point number and confirming the result is an integer
  like I should.
</Aside>

### Helpers

Coding that math into a function.

It returns something when the found intersection of the 2 lines is the same as the location of the prize.  
If the intersection exists, but is not reachable in whole button presses, the function returns nothing.

```rust
fn solve(a: Point, b: Point, prize: Point) -> Option<i64> {
    // lines are never parallel in this question
    assert!(((a.y as f64 / a.x as f64) - (b.y as f64 / b.x as f64)).abs() > f64::EPSILON);

    let na = ((prize.x * b.y) - (prize.y * b.x)) / ((a.x * b.y) - (a.y * b.x));
    let nb = (prize.x - na * a.x) / b.x;
    let solution = Point::new(na * a.x + nb * b.x, na * a.y + nb * b.y);
    (solution == prize).then_some(3 * na + nb)
}
```

### Code

A short function because of the helper functions again.

- Parse the input into a list of `[A, B, Prize]` points.
- Solve using that combination of `Point`s
- If solveable: add the solution cost to the sum

```rust title=day_13.rs
fn part_1(input: &str) -> i64 {
    parse(input)
        .into_iter()
        .filter_map(|[a, b, prize]| solve(a, b, prize))
        .sum()
}
```

## Part 2

Woopsie, small mistake.
The prize coordinates are both (x and y) 10 trillion less than what they should have been.

```rust {1,6-7}
const TEN_TRILLY: i64 = 10_000_000_000_000;
pub fn part_2(input: &str) -> i64 {
    parse(input)
        .into_iter()
        .filter_map(|[a, b, mut prize]| {
            prize.x += TEN_TRILLY;
            prize.y += TEN_TRILLY;
            solve(a, b, prize)
        })
        .sum()
}
```

## Final code

```rust title=day_13.rs showLineNumbers
use itertools::Itertools;

#[derive(PartialEq, Eq)]
struct Point {
    x: i64,
    y: i64,
}

impl Point {
    fn new(x: i64, y: i64) -> Self {
        Self { x, y }
    }
}

fn parse(input: &str) -> Vec<[Point; 3]> {
    let mut machines = Vec::new();
    for block in input.split("\n\n") {
        let (adx, ady, bdx, bdy, x, y) = block
            .split(|c: char| !c.is_ascii_digit())
            .filter(|s| !s.is_empty())
            .map(|s| s.parse().unwrap())
            .collect_tuple()
            .unwrap();
        let a = Point::new(adx, ady);
        let b = Point::new(bdx, bdy);
        let prize = Point::new(x, y);
        machines.push([a, b, prize]);
    }
    machines
}

fn solve(a: Point, b: Point, prize: Point) -> Option<i64> {
    // lines are never parallel in this question
    assert!((a.y as f64 / a.x as f64) != (b.y as f64 / b.x as f64));

    let na = ((prize.x * b.y) - (prize.y * b.x)) / ((a.x * b.y) - (a.y * b.x));
    let nb = (prize.x - na * a.x) / b.x;
    let solution = Point::new(na * a.x + nb * b.x, na * a.y + nb * b.y);
    (solution == prize).then_some(3 * na + nb)
}

pub fn part_1(input: &str) -> i64 {
    parse(input)
        .into_iter()
        .filter_map(|[a, b, prize]| solve(a, b, prize))
        .sum()
}

const TEN_TRILLY: i64 = 10_000_000_000_000;
pub fn part_2(input: &str) -> i64 {
    parse(input)
        .into_iter()
        .filter_map(|[a, b, mut prize]| {
            prize.x += TEN_TRILLY;
            prize.y += TEN_TRILLY;
            solve(a, b, prize)
        })
        .sum()
}
```
