## Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors

https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2

<Aside>
TL;DR: [my solution in Rust](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/scrapyard/blob/main/advent_of_code/2022/src/day_02.rs)
</Aside>

We're playing a [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) tournament with the elves.
The input represents an encryped strategy guide.

Each line has 2 letters seperated by a space.

- The first letter is `A`, `B`, or `C`.
- The second letter is `X`, `Y`, or `Z`.

An example input looks like this:

```txt title=input.txt
A Y
B X
C Z
```

Each round is worth some points, all scores get summed up, and whoever has the highest total at the end of the tournament wins.

Your score for a single round is the sum of the score for the _shape_ you played, and the score for the _outcome_ of the round.

Shape scores:
- Rock: 1
- Paper: 2
- Scissors: 3

Outcome scores:
- Loss: 0
- Draw: 3
- Win: 6

The first letter in the input is what your opponent is going to play.
`A`for Rock, `B` for Paper, and `C` for Scissors.

Before the elf can tell you what the second letter means, they leave.

## Part 1

Winning every round would be suspicious, so whatever that second letter is, it has to be important.

You assume the second letter is the shape you should play.
`X`for Rock, `Y` for Paper, and `Z` for Scissors.

If "Rock", "Paper", and "Scissors" have positions in a list.

- To win, move 1 position to the right (and wrap around from "Scissors" to "Rock"!)
- To draw, keep the same position
- To lose, move 1 position to the left (and wrap around from "Rock" to "Scissors"!)

So I translated both `A`, `B`, `C`, and `X`, `Y`, `Z` to `0`, `1`, and `2` respectively.
Thankfully, both ABC and XYZ are sequences where the [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) value of a letter increases by 1 each step.

- The value for the _shape_ the opponent plays is known.
- The value for the _shape_ I play is known.
- To calculate the score for this round, we need to know the _outcome_ of the round.

With those two pieces of information a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors can be expressed as the following equation:

`outcome = my_shape - opponent_shape + 1 (mod 3)`

This expresses `outcome` as a number from 0 to 2:
- 0 for loss
- 1 for draw
- 2 for win

<Aside variant="info">
The `mod 3` handles the wrapping around logic.

```rust title=day_02.rs
pub fn part_1() -> String {
    let input = std::fs::read_to_string("src/day02.txt").unwrap();

    input
        .lines()
        // map every line to the score for that round
        .map(|line| {
            // transform A B C and X Y Z to 0 1 2 respectively by using their ASCII order
            let bytes = line.as_bytes();
            let left = (bytes[0] - b'A') as i8;
            let right = (bytes[2] - b'X') as i8;

            // 0 for rock, 1 for paper, 2 for scissors
            // 0 for loss, 1 for draw, 2 for win
            let opponent_shape = left;
            let my_shape = right;
            let outcome = (my_shape - opponent_shape + 1).rem_euclid(3);

            let shape_score = my_shape + 1;
            let outcome_score = 3 * outcome;
            (shape_score + outcome_score) as u32
        })
        .sum::<u32>()
        .to_string()
}
```

## Part 2

The elf returns and tells you that the second letter in the input is the desired _outcome_.
`X` for loss, `Y` for draw, `Z` for win.

- The value for the _shape_ the opponent plays is known.
- The value for the _outcome_ of the round is known.
- To calculate the score for this round, we need to know the _shape_ we need to play.

We rearrange the equation from part1 to solve for `my_shape` instead of `outcome`:

`my_shape = opponent_shape - 1 + outcome (mod 3)`

pub fn part_2() -> String {

    input
        .lines()
        // map every line to the score for that round
        .map(|line| {
            // transform A B C and X Y Z to 0 1 2 respectively by using their ASCII order
            let bytes = line.as_bytes();
            let left = (bytes[0] - b'A') as i8;
            let right = (bytes[2] - b'X') as i8;

            // 0 for rock, 1 for paper, 2 for scissors
            // 0 for loss, 1 for draw, 2 for win
            let opponent_shape = left;
            let outcome = right;
            let my_shape = (opponent_shape - 1 + outcome).rem_euclid(3);

            let shape_score = my_shape + 1;
            let outcome_score = 3 * outcome;
            (shape_score + outcome_score) as u32
        })
        .sum::<u32>()
        .to_string()
}
```
