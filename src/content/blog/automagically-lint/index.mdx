import MultiCode from "$components/MultiCode.astro";

<Aside>

You can skip all the explanation and go straight to [the part with all the steps](#tldr-version) to make [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) automagically lint and format your code.

Prefer to see [an example repo](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/automagical-linting)?

</Aside>

Setting up your editor to automatically [lint](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)>) and format code leaves you free to think about the functionality of that code. Not whether or not a variable is defined or if you should insert more whitespace.

To achieve this goal for a JavaScript project, you can use 2 powerful tools.

- The linting part can be handled by [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- The formatting part can be handled by [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

On their own, those tools are very powerful.  
Combined, they will make you feel like you have superpowers.

## Initial Setup

If you want to follow along, I'll start a new project from scratch.

```bash
mkdir automagical-linting
cd automagical-linting
```

Initialize a `package.json` with your favorite tool.

<MultiCode>

<Fragment slot="yarn">

```bash title=automagical-linting
yarn init -y
```

</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="npm">

```bash title=automagical-linting
npm init -y
```

</Fragment>

</MultiCode>

Open an editor in the newly created directory.

We'll install everything we need locally, as a devDependency.
That way we avoid a big part of the _"works on my machine"_-factor.

Don't worry, there's no magic here, I'll briefly explain what each package we use does.

<Aside variant="info">
  "devDependencies": Packages that are only needed for local development and
  testing.
</Aside>

## Starting with ESLint

Start by installing the main linting package ([ESLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint)), and the main formatting package ([Prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier)).

<MultiCode>

<Fragment slot="yarn">

```bash title=automagical-linting
yarn add eslint prettier -D
```

</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="npm">

```bash title=automagical-linting
npm i eslint prettier -D
```

</Fragment>

</MultiCode>

Next, initialize ESLint.
The initialization will ask you a couple of questions and set up a configuration file that reflects your answers.

<MultiCode>

<Fragment slot="yarn">

```bash title=automagical-linting
yarn run eslint --init
```

</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="npm">

```bash title=automagical-linting
npx eslint --init
```

</Fragment>

</MultiCode>

![eslint initialization](init.png)

Here are the choices I made:

- How would you like to use ESLint?  
  To check syntax, find problems, and enforce code style
- What type of modules does your project use?  
  JavaScript modules (import/export)
- Which framework does your project use?  
  React
- Does your project use TypeScript?  
  No
- Where does your code run?  
  Browser, Node
- How would you like to define a style for your project?  
  Use a popular style guide
- Which style guide do you want to follow?  
  [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- What format do you want your config file to be in?  
  `JSON`
- Would you like to install them now with npm?  
  No

This process will create a `.eslintrc.json` file in the root folder of the project.

Because I used `yarn` instead of `npm`, I chose not to install the extra needed packages with npm.

If you also answered no, install the needed packages manually.
In my case that meant installing everything [`eslint-config-airbnb`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) needs with `yarn`.

```bash
npx install-peerdeps --dev eslint-config-airbnb
```

<Aside variant="info">

I chose to use the version of the Airbnb styleguide for React, so quite a few React specific packages will be installed.
This is not a problem! They just won't do anything until I set up React in this project.

</Aside>

### Running ESLint

Any file or directory can now be linted by running `eslint <path>`.
The rules to follow are determined by that `.eslintrc.json` file.

I created an `index.js` file with some sloppy code in the root of the `automagical-linting/` directory.

To check this file:

<MultiCode>

<Fragment slot="yarn">

```bash title=automagical-linting
yarn eslint index.js
```

</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="npm">

```bash title=automagical-linting
npx eslint index.js
```

</Fragment>

</MultiCode>

Lots of errors! Oh no!

These are all coming from rules the [`airbnb` styleguide](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) sets.

We'll configure the rules to our liking later.
First, it's time to add the main formatting package to the mix!

### Adding the power of Prettier

#### Using Prettier through ESLint

Next up is the [Prettier plugin package for ESLint](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier)

<MultiCode>

<Fragment slot="yarn">

```bash title=automagical-linting
yarn add eslint-plugin-prettier -D
```

</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="npm">

```bash title=automagical-linting
npm i eslint-plugin-prettier -D
```

</Fragment>

</MultiCode>

This package will run Prettier as an ESLint rule and reports differences as individual ESLint issues.

To use it we'll add `"prettier"` to the `"plugins"` array and report all differences by setting the `"prettier/prettier"` rule.

```json title=.eslintrc.json hl=3,5
{
  // --snip--
  "plugins": ["react", "prettier"],
  "rules": {
    "prettier/prettier": "warn"
  }
}
```

<Aside variant="info">

I set the issues prettier finds to be reported as warnings, if you prefer you can set them to be reported as errors.

```json
"prettier/prettier": "error"
```

</Aside>

#### Prevent conflicts between ESLint and Prettier

The problem we are faced with if we combine ESLint and Prettier is: both tools have significant overlap.
Some rules exist in both packages, causing conflicts between the two.

To prevent the conflicts we'll install and configure the [Prettier config package for ESLint](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier).
This package disables all formatting-related ESLint rules.

<MultiCode>

<Fragment slot="yarn">

```bash title=automagical-linting
yarn add eslint-config-prettier -D
```

</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="npm">

```bash title=automagical-linting
npm i eslint-config-prettier -D
```

</Fragment>

</MultiCode>

To use it, add `"prettier"` to the `"extends"` array in the `eslintrc` file.

```json title=.eslintrc.json hl=3
{
  // --snip--
  "extends": ["plugin:react/recommended", "airbnb", "prettier"],
  "plugins": ["react", "prettier"],
  "rules": {
    "prettier/prettier": "warn"
  }
}
```

<Aside variant="danger">

Make sure the `"prettier"` rules are last, that way they overwrite previous configurations.

</Aside>

<Aside variant="danger">

`"arrow-body-style"` and `"prefer-arrow-callback"` are two ESLint core rules that can cause [issues with this plugin](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier#arrow-body-style-and-prefer-arrow-callback-issue), so turn them off.

```json title=.eslintrc.json hl=5,6
{
  // --snip--
  "rules": {
    "prettier/prettier": "warn",
    "arrow-body-style": "off",
    "prefer-arrow-callback": "off"
  }
}
```

</Aside>

### Dictating our own rules

While the [Airbnb configuration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) contains an excellent set of rules, we'll make this linting/formatting setup our own and use the existing configuation as a starting point.

#### Prettier configuration

Let's add some rules specific to Prettier to our ESLint configuration.

The `"prettier/prettier"` rule can be set to an array, and the second item in that array accepts an object with [Prettier rules](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html)

```json title=.eslintrc.json
{
  // --snip--
  "rules": {
    "prettier/prettier": [
      "warn",
      {
        "semi": false
      }
    ]
    // --snip--
  }
}
```

<Aside variant="info">

If you prefer to set these rules via a `.prettierrc` file, that's possible
too.

</Aside>

<Aside variant="info">

Prettier rules specified in the `eslintrc` file will overwrite ones
in a `prettierrc` file.

</Aside>

#### More ESLint configuration

Next we'll override/add to some of the rules set by the Airbnb styleguide by adding some entries to the `"rules"` object.

```json title=.eslintrc.json hl=7-13
{
  // --snip--
  "rules": {
    "prettier/prettier": "warn",
    "arrow-body-style": "off",
    "prefer-arrow-callback": "off",
    "no-unused-vars": [
      "error",
      {
        "vars": "local",
        "args": "none"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The code snippets above are examples of what you could do, check out the configuration options for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html) and for [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring) for more information.

## Run the linting setup

If we try to run ESLint on `index.js` again, there are even more lines of output now!

<MultiCode>

<Fragment slot="yarn">

```bash title=automagical-linting
yarn eslint index.js
```

</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="npm">

```bash title=automagical-linting
npx eslint index.js
```

</Fragment>

</MultiCode>

These extra lines are coming from Prettier and are about the formatting of the code.

I like semicolons, so I changed the `"prettier/prettier"` rule to require them.

<Aside variant="info">

Prettier's default settings enable semicolons, so I deleted the `"semi": false` line in the Prettier config

</Aside>

For our next trick, we will run `eslint` with the `--fix` flag.
Watch the `index.js` file while you run the next command.

<MultiCode>

<Fragment slot="yarn">

```bash title=automagical-linting
yarn eslint src --fix
```

</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="npm">

```bash title=automagical-linting
npx eslint src --fix
```

</Fragment>

</MultiCode>

Much better!

All the errors that were automatically fixable are now gone.
That's quite a lot, of the 50+ issues I had before, only a few remain.

<Aside variant="info">

I haven't installed React in this demo project yet, so it notified me about it not being there, neat!

</Aside>

Both Prettier and Eslint have a bunch of rules that are automatically fixable.
That means that not only will the file you run `eslint --fix` on be formatted (according to the Prettier rules),
it will also do things like changing `let` to `const` where appropriate [if you wish](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/prefer-const).

- [Eslint rules](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/) that are automatically fixable have a wrench icon next to them in the linked docs.
- [Prettier rules](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html) are all automatically fixable.

## A tighter feedback loop: editor configuration

While this is very powerful, faster feedback would be very useful.

I'm using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as editor, so that's the one I'll cover here.
The same result can be achieved in many other editors.

### Editor plugin

Install the [VSCode ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).

This extension will display the errors inside the editor, by showing squiggly lines underneath the detected problems.

Those detected problems will appear while you write code, no need to fiddle with the terminal!

A huge step up from the output we saw in the terminal!

![Squiggly lines beneath detected errors](squigglies.png)

### Automatically fix issues on save

We can take it [a step further](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xgx4k83zzc) and make VSCode perform linting and formatting fixes each time a file is saved.

Go to the user-settings (`file > preferences > settings`)

<Aside variant="info">

I prefer to keep these settings in the "workspace" tab so they are specific to
this project.

</Aside>

Automatically run `eslint --fix` on save by enabling the `fixAll.eslint` setting.

```json title=settings.json
{
  // --snip--
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  }
}
```

After reloading the editor, go to a `.js` file and try out your fancy new setup!

Try writing the following snippet and save the file.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```js title=index.js
var num=1
var newNum=num+5;;
```

It will turn into

```js title=index.js
const num = 1;
const newNum = num + 5;
```

The whitespace and semicolons were handled by the Prettier plugin.
The `var`s turned into `const`s because of the [no-var rule](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-var) that was enabled.

#### Bonus: Prettier VSCode extension

Prettier is now integrated into our ESLint setup.
That only applies to `.js` files.

Prettier also [supports other languages](https://prettier.io/docs/en/)!

To use the formatting power of Prettier on other languages too, you can install an editor extension for Prettier.

[VSCode Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

Since we set up Prettier to run through ESLint, disable the editor extension for `.js`.  
Otherwise, the editor extension and the ESLint plugin might have a fight ~~for world domination~~.

Enabling the prettier formatter for all languages except JavaScript is what we want.

That can be done in the VSCode settings

```json title=settings.json
{
  // --snip--
  // enable prettier as default formatter for all supported filetypes
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  // JavaScript specific settings:
  "[javascript]": {
    // disable prettier
    "editor.defaultFormatter": null
  }
}
```

Now Prettier wil run on all file formats it supports except for JavaScript, those files will be handled by our ESLint setup.

I like Prettier to fix files on save, so I set that up too.

```json title=settings.json hl=4,12
{
  // --snip--
  // Format all filetypes on save
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  // enable prettier as default formatter for all supported filetypes
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  // JavaScript specific settings:
  "[javascript]": {
    // disable prettier
    "editor.defaultFormatter": null,
    // disable formatting on save
    "editor.formatOnSave": false
  }
}
```

Ready to test it out!

Try writing a `.css` file that's badly formatted.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```css title=styles.css
html        { background-color: gray}
```

Save the file and POW, automatic formatting.

```css title=styles.css
html {
  background-color: gray;
}
```

## Success!

<Aside variant="success">
  We successfully set up ESLint to work together with Prettier.
</Aside>

We get notified in our editor about linting problems that ESLint picks up and about
formatting problems that Prettier picks up. Each time we save a `.js` file those
2 packages will work together and fix all the issues that they can (as it turns out,
that's quite a lot of them).

Go and write some beautiful code!

## TL;DR version

Install deps.

```bash
npm i eslint prettier eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-config-prettier -D
```

Initialise an eslint configuration

```bash
npx eslint --init
```

Add options to that eslint configuration

```json title=.eslintrc.json
{
  "extends": ["prettier"],
  "plugins": ["prettier"],
  "rules": {
    "prettier/prettier": "warn",
    "arrow-body-style": "off",
    "prefer-arrow-callback": "off"
  }
}
```

Install the ESLint editor plugin. Like the [VSCode ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

If you also want to format other languages, install the Prettier editor plugin. Like the [VSCode Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

Optionally configure your editor to fix linting and formatting problems on save.

My relevant VSCode settings:

```json title=settings.json
// these settings format all file types but js on save with the prettier vscode extension
// for javascript, prettier is ran through eslint, and on save eslint --fix is ran
// eslint errors are shown in the editor with the eslint vscode extension, the status is always shown
{
  // Format all filetypes on save
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  // enable prettier as default formatter for all supported filetypes
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  // JavaScript specific settings:
  "[javascript]": {
    // disable prettier
    "editor.defaultFormatter": null,
    // disable formatting on save
    "editor.formatOnSave": false
  },
  // run eslint --fix on save
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  },
  // always show eslint in the statusbar
  "eslint.alwaysShowStatus": true
}
```
