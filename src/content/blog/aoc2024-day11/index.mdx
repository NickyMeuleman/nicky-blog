## Day 11: Plutonian Pebbles

https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/11

<Aside>
  TL;DR: [my solution in
  Rust](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/scrapyard/blob/main/advent_of_code/2024/solutions/src/day_11.rs)
</Aside>

Another day, another [familiar location](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/20).

You are in a spot with a bunch of numbered stones in a straight line.

An example input looks like this:

```txt title=input.txt
0 1 10 99 999
```

The input is one line.
Each stone number is separated by a space.

Each time you blink, the stones change all at once according to a few rules.

> Ooh, I know this one, it's a cellular automaton, like the [game of life](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Life)

The rules for how the (markings on the) stones change:

- 0 becomes 1
- Even number of digit stones turn into 2 new stones:
  1. Left stone gets the first half of the digits
  1. Right stone gets the second half of the digits
- Otherwise, the number get multiplied by 2024

<Aside variant="danger">
  Do not be fooled by the bold text that says **"order is preserved"**, it's a
  red herring. The stones are completely independent from each other, so their
  order does not matter.
</Aside>

## Parsing

Because each stone is completely independent,
and stones with the same number acts in exactly the same way,
I chose to work on a map of key-value pairs where a key is a stone number,
and the value is the amount of stones with that number.

Oh, and this is a day again where the numbers can get **large**.

```rust
fn parse(input: &str) -> HashMap<u64, u64> {
    let mut stones: HashMap<u64, u64> = HashMap::new();
    for num in input.split_ascii_whitespace() {
        let num = num.parse().unwrap();
        *stones.entry(num).or_default() += 1;
    }
    stones
}
```

## Helper

Implementing the rules for what happens when you blink.
This helper function takes in a map of stones, and returns a new map of stones.

```rust
fn blink(stones: &HashMap<u64, u64>) -> HashMap<u64, u64> {
    let mut new = HashMap::new();
    for (stone, amount) in stones {
        if *stone == 0 {
            *new.entry(1).or_default() += amount;
        } else {
            let digits = stone.ilog10() + 1;
            if digits % 2 == 0 {
                let magnitude = 10u64.pow(digits / 2);
                *new.entry(stone % magnitude).or_default() += amount;
                *new.entry(stone / magnitude).or_default() += amount;
            } else {
                *new.entry(stone * 2024).or_default() += amount;
            }
        }
    }
    new
}
```

## Part 1

The question asks how many stones there would be after blinking 25 times.

```rust title=day_11.rs
fn part_1(input: &str) -> u64 {
    let mut stones = parse(input);
    for _ in 0..25 {
        stones = blink(&stones);
    }
    stones.values().sum()
}
```

## Part 2

What was this, blinking [for ants?!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ffj8SHrbk0),
it needs to be at least 3 times bigger!

The question asks how many stones there would be after blinking 75 times.

1. Take the part 1 code
1. Change 25 to 75
1. Success

```rust title=day_11.rs {3}
fn part_2(input: &str) -> u64 {
    let mut stones = parse(input);
    for _ in 0..75 {
        stones = blink(&stones);
    }
    stones.values().sum()
}
```

## Final code

To combine both parts:
Looping 75 times and recording the sum at loop number 25.

```rust title=day_11.rs showLineNumbers
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn parse(input: &str) -> HashMap<u64, u64> {
    let mut stones: HashMap<u64, u64> = HashMap::new();
    for num in input.split_ascii_whitespace() {
        let num = num.parse().unwrap();
        *stones.entry(num).or_default() += 1;
    }
    stones
}

fn blink(stones: &HashMap<u64, u64>) -> HashMap<u64, u64> {
    let mut new = HashMap::new();
    for (stone, amount) in stones {
        if *stone == 0 {
            *new.entry(1).or_default() += amount;
        } else {
            let digits = stone.ilog10() + 1;
            if digits % 2 == 0 {
                let magnitude = 10u64.pow(digits / 2);
                *new.entry(stone % magnitude).or_default() += amount;
                *new.entry(stone / magnitude).or_default() += amount;
            } else {
                *new.entry(stone * 2024).or_default() += amount;
            }
        }
    }
    new
}

fn both(input: &str) -> (u64, u64) {
    let mut stones = parse(input);
    let mut p1 = 0;
    for i in 0..75 {
        if i == 25 {
            p1 = stones.values().sum();
        }
        stones = blink(&stones);
    }
    (p1, stones.values().sum())
}
```
