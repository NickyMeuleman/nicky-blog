## Day 7: Camel Cards

https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/7

<Aside>
TL;DR: [my solution in Rust](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/scrapyard/blob/main/advent_of_code/2023/solutions/src/day_07.rs)
</Aside>

You arrive at Desert Island, an elf is there waiting to take you to your destination.
A trip by camel!

The elf wants to play a game while travelling appropriately named camel cards.

It's similar to poker, but a bit simpler, because that makes it easier to play while riding a camel.

You get a list of hands of cards.
You need to order those hands based on the strength of each hand.

A hand consists of five cards.

The cards are all one of:
- A
- K
- Q
- J
- T
- 9
- 8
- 7
- 6
- 5
- 4
- 3
- 2

Each hand of 5 cards has a type of:
- Five of a kind

    All cards have the same label.

    eg: AAAAA
- Four of a kind

    Four cards have the same label.

    eg: AA8AA
- Full House

    Three cards have the same label, the two other cards have the same label.

    eg: 23332
- Three of a kind

    Three cards have the same label.

    eg: TTT98
- Two pair

    Two cards have the same label.  
    Two other cards also have the same label.

    eg: 23432
- One pair

    Two cards have the same label.

    eg: A23A4
- High card

    All card labels are different.

    eg: 23456

Each hand has a bid associated with it, it number.

If two hands have the same type, their order is determined by looking which hand has a stronger card first.

eg: hand1 is `33332`, and hand2 is `2AAAA`.

Both hands have the same type (four of a kind).
`33332` is stronger because the first card is stronger.
If the first card is identical, the second card is compared, and so forth until one hand is stronger (two hands being completely identical never happens in the input).

Today's input is a list of hands with their corresponding bids.

An example input looks like this:

```txt title=input.txt
32T3K 765
T55J5 684
KK677 28
KTJJT 220
QQQJA 483
```

## Part 1

Order the hands in the input.

The weakest hand gets rank 1, the next one rank 2, and so on.

For each hand, multiply its rank by its bid to determine the hands winnings.

The question asks you determine the total winnings for all hands.

### Option 1: lots of functions

Starting with some pseudo/skeleton-code again:

```rust
input
    .lines()
    .map(/* turn a line into a (cards, bid) pair*/)
    .sorted()
    .map(/* multiply rank with bid */)
    .sum()
```

#### Helpers

I chose to represent the value of a single card as a number, ordered like the question specifies.

```rust
fn card_value(c: char) -> usize {
    "23456789TJQKA".chars().position(|card| card == c).unwrap()
}
```

To score a single hand, I used a list of 2 sorted numbers:
1. The amount of cards that appear the most often
1. The amount of cards that appears the 2nd most often

Some examples:
- `[3, 2]` represents a hand with 3 cards of equal value, and 2 cards with a different identical value
- `[3, 1]` represents a hand with 3 cards of equal value, and 1 card with a different value. (not represented is the last card that also has a different value)
- `[5, 0]` represents a hand with 5 cards of equal value.
- `[2, 2]` represents a hand with 2 pairs.

```rust
fn hand_score(hand: &str) -> [u8; 2] {
    let mut faces = [0_u8; 13];
    for c in hand.chars() {
        faces[card_value(c)] += 1;
    }
    faces.sort_unstable();
    let mut score: [u8; 2] = faces[11..].try_into().unwrap();
    score.reverse();
    score
}
```

And finally, using those building blocks, a way to compare 2 hands and determine which one is stronger.

```rust
fn compare_hands(a: &str, b: &str) -> Ordering {
    hand_score(a).cmp(&hand_score(b)).then_with(|| {
        let (a, b) = a
            .chars()
            .zip(b.chars())
            .find(|(a, b)| a != b)
            .expect("hands are completely identical");

        card_value(a).cmp(&card_value(b))
    })
}
```

#### Code

```rust title=day_07.rs
use itertools::Itertools;
use std::cmp::Ordering;

pub fn part_1(input: &str) -> usize {
    input
        .lines()
        .map(|line| {
            let (hand, bid) = line.split_once(" ").unwrap();
            (hand, bid)
        })
        .sorted_by(|(a, _), (b, _)| compare_hands(a, b))
        .enumerate()
        .map(|(idx, (_, bid))| (idx + 1) * bid.parse::<usize>().unwrap())
        .sum()
}

fn compare_hands(a: &str, b: &str) -> Ordering {
    hand_score(a).cmp(&hand_score(b)).then_with(|| {
        let (a, b) = a
            .chars()
            .zip(b.chars())
            .find(|(a, b)| a != b)
            .expect("hands are completely identical");

        card_value(a).cmp(&card_value(b))
    })
}

fn hand_score(hand: &str) -> [u8; 2] {
    let mut faces = [0_u8; 13];
    for c in hand.chars() {
        faces[card_value(c)] += 1;
    }
    faces.sort_unstable();
    let mut score: [u8; 2] = faces[11..].try_into().unwrap();
    score.reverse();
    score
}

fn card_value(c: char) -> usize {
    "23456789TJQKA".chars().position(|card| card == c).unwrap()
}
```

### Option 2: structures

I like to put data in neat structures.
Rust structs are great.

Because the input is a string, I store references to that string in those structures.
Those need a lifetime, and that's that `'a` stuff you see all over the place.

I'm not going deep into what that means in this post, but in a nutshell it means "this string is valid while this structure exists".

By Implementing [`Ord`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html) we tell Rust those structures can be ordered.

#### Code

```rust title=day_07.rs
use itertools::Itertools;
use std::cmp::Ordering;

#[derive(PartialEq, Eq)]
struct Hand<'a> {
    cards: &'a str,
    bid: u32,
}

impl<'a> Hand<'a> {
    fn score(&self) -> [u8; 2] {
        let mut faces = [0; 13];
        for c in self.cards.chars() {
            faces[card_value(c)] += 1;
        }
        faces.sort_unstable();
        let mut score: [u8; 2] = faces[11..].try_into().unwrap();
        score.reverse();
        score
    }
}

impl<'a> PartialOrd for Hand<'a> {
    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<Ordering> {
        Some(self.cmp(other))
    }
}

impl<'a> Ord for Hand<'a> {
    fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering {
        self.score().cmp(&other.score()).then_with(|| {
            let (a, b) = self
                .cards
                .chars()
                .zip(other.cards.chars())
                .find(|(a, b)| a != b)
                .expect("hands are completely identical");

            card_value(a).cmp(&card_value(b))
        })
    }
}

pub fn part_1(input: &str) -> u32 {
    input
        .lines()
        .map(|line| {
            let (cards, bid) = line.split_once(" ").unwrap();
            Hand {
                cards,
                bid: bid.parse().unwrap(),
            }
        })
        .sorted_unstable()
        .enumerate()
        .map(|(idx, turn)| (idx as u32 + 1) * turn.bid)
        .sum()
}
```

### Option 3: getting shifty

I didn't implement this but you can also represent a hand as a single number.

4 bits represent each card.
The starting bits represent the type of hand (from five of a kind to high card).

This would work by determining the value of each card, and shifting bits to represent that value onto a number.
Then, shift a value representing the type of the hand onto the front of the same number.

Sorting those numbers would apply the sorting logic described where it sorts based on the type of hand first, and on the individual cards next.

## Part 2

There is a second way to play this game.

The `J` cards are now jokers, wildcards that can act like any other card.

You can use these jokers in a hand to make a stronger type of hand.

To balance this, the `J` card is now the weakest card.

This causes a few adjustments to the code from part1.

### Helpers

The function to determine the value of a single card:
```rust
fn card_value2(c: char) -> usize {
    "J23456789TQKA".chars().position(|card| card == c).unwrap()
}
```

The function to score a hand:
```rust
fn hand_score2(hand: &str) -> [u8; 2] {
    let mut faces = [0; 13];
    let mut jokers = 0;
    for c in hand.chars() {
        if c == 'J' {
            jokers += 1;
        } else {
            faces[card_value2(c)] += 1;
        }
    }
    faces.sort_unstable();
    let mut score: [u8; 2] = faces[11..].try_into().unwrap();
    score.reverse();
    // add the amount of jokers to the counts of the card that occurs the most already to increase the hand score
    score[0] += jokers;
    score
}
```

The function to compare 2 hands:
```rust
fn compare_hands2(a: &str, b: &str) -> Ordering {
    hand_score2(a).cmp(&hand_score2(b)).then_with(|| {
        let (a, b) = a
            .chars()
            .zip(b.chars())
            .find(|(a, b)| a != b)
            .expect("hands are completely identical");

        card_value2(a).cmp(&card_value2(b))
    })
}
```

The result is nearly identical code to part one.
It would be trivial to implement a boolean flag and combine these 2 version into one, but I had somewhere to go and copy-pasting was faster.

### Code

```rust title=day_07.rs
use itertools::Itertools;
use std::cmp::Ordering;

pub fn part_2(input: &str) -> usize {
    input
        .lines()
        .map(|line| {
            let (hand, bid) = line.split_once(" ").unwrap();
            (hand, bid)
        })
        .sorted_by(|(a, _), (b, _)| compare_hands2(a, b))
        .enumerate()
        .map(|(idx, (_, bid))| (idx + 1) * bid.parse::<usize>().unwrap())
        .sum()
}

fn compare_hands2(a: &str, b: &str) -> Ordering {
    hand_score2(a).cmp(&hand_score2(b)).then_with(|| {
        let (a, b) = a
            .chars()
            .zip(b.chars())
            .find(|(a, b)| a != b)
            .expect("hands are completely identical");

        card_value2(a).cmp(&card_value2(b))
    })
}

fn hand_score2(hand: &str) -> [u8; 2] {
    let mut faces = [0; 13];
    let mut jokers = 0;
    for c in hand.chars() {
        if c == 'J' {
            jokers += 1;
        } else {
            faces[card_value2(c)] += 1;
        }
    }
    faces.sort_unstable();
    let mut score: [u8; 2] = faces[11..].try_into().unwrap();
    score.reverse();
    // add the amount of jokers to the counts of the card that occurs the most already to increase the hand score
    score[0] += jokers;
    score
}

fn card_value2(c: char) -> usize {
    "J23456789TQKA".chars().position(|card| card == c).unwrap()
}
```
