## Day 17: Chronospatial Computer

  TL;DR: [my solution in
  Rust](https://github.com/NickyMeuleman/scrapyard/blob/main/advent_of_code/2024/solutions/src/day_17.rs)
</Aside>

Another day, another ... [familiar sensation](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/6) this time, as you're falling.

You need to debug the handheld timetravel/teleportation-device you have been using throughout this advent.

It has a computer with 3 registers, those are storage spots for numbers.
The program it is trying to run consists of a list of numbers, and it is listed at the bottom of the input.

An example input looks like this:

```txt title=input.txt
Register A: 729
Register B: 0
Register C: 0

Program: 0,1,5,4,3,0
```

## Parsing

I parsed today's input into a list of numbers, nothing fancy.

- first number is A
- second number is B
- third number is C
- the rest of the numbers are the program

```rust
fn parse(input: &str) -> Vec<u64> {
    input
        .split(|c: char| !c.is_ascii_digit())
        .filter(|s| !s.is_empty())
        .map(|s| s.parse().unwrap())
        .collect()
}
```

## Part 1

The computer uses an **instruction pointer**, it functions as an index into the program.
That instruction pointer starts as 0, so it starts off pointing at the first number in the program (a list of numbers).

A computer looks like this:

```rust
struct Computer {
    ip: usize,
    a: u64,
    b: u64,
    c: u64,
    program: Vec<u64>,
}
```

The program can do 8 operations.

Each operation uses 2 numbers from the program memory.

1. The **opcode** at `program[ip]`
1. The **operand** at `program[ip + 2]`

Per time it does an operation, I increment the `ip` (instruction pointer) by 2 to move past the 2 numbers the computer just used.

Which type of instruction is executed is determined by the **opcode**.
It might change the numbers in the registers, or change the `ip`.

The operand might get modified before it gets used by an instruction.
There are 2 options:

1. literal operand: operand remains unchanged
1. combo operand:
   - operands 0 through 3 remain unchanged
   - operand 4 turn into the value of register A.
   - operand 5 turn into the value of register B.
   - operand 6 turn into the value of register C.
   - operand 7 is reserved and will not appear in valid programs.

The 8 instructions:

- `**` represents exponentiation.
- `^` represent the bitwise XOR operation
- `%` represents a modulo operation

0. `adv`: `a / (2 ** combo)`, store result in `a`
1. `bxl`: `b ^ literal`, store result in the `b`
2. `bst`: `combo % 8`, store result in `b`
3. `jnz`: change `ip` to literal operand if `a` is not 0
4. `bxc`: `b ^ c` store result in `b` (this operation ignores its operand)
5. `out`: `combo % 8`, output result
6. `bdv`: `a / (2 ** combo)`, store result in `b`
7. `cdv`: `a / (2 ** combo)`, store result in `c`

### Helpers

I used a data structure that holds a computer.

- It has a method to turn an operand into a combo operand.
- It has a method that runs the program until it outputs a number or halts (the instruction pointer points outside of the program memory).

```rust
struct Computer<'a> {
    ip: usize,
    a: u64,
    b: u64,
    c: u64,
    program: &'a [u64],
}

impl Computer<'_> {
    fn combo(&self, operand: u64) -> u64 {
        match operand {
            0..=3 => operand,
            4 => self.a,
            5 => self.b,
            6 => self.c,
            _ => panic!("at the disco"),
        }
    }
    fn run(&mut self) -> Option<u64> {
        while self.ip < self.program.len() {
            let opcode = self.program[self.ip];
            let operand = self.program[self.ip + 1];
            self.ip += 2;

            match opcode {
                // adv: a/2^combo, store in a
                0 => self.a >>= self.combo(operand),
                // bxl: bitwise xor of b and literal-operand, store in b
                1 => self.b ^= operand,
                // bst: combo % 8, store in b
                2 => self.b = self.combo(operand) % 8,
                // jnz: jump to literal operand if a not zero
                3 => {
                    if self.a != 0 {
                        self.ip = operand as usize;
                        continue;
                    }
                }
                // bxc: bitwise xor of b and c, store in b (ignores operand)
                4 => self.b ^= self.c,
                // out: combo % 8, outputs result
                5 => {
                    let out = self.combo(operand) % 8;
                    return Some(out);
                }
                // bdv: a/2^combo, store in b
                6 => self.b = self.a >> self.combo(operand),
                // cdv: a/2^combo, store in c
                7 => self.c = self.a >> self.combo(operand),
                _ => panic!("at the disco"),
            }
        }

        None
    }
}
```

### Code

The question asks you to print the all the numbers the computer outputs, and place a comma between each one.

```rust title=day_17.rs
pub fn part_1(input: &str) -> String {
    let nums = parse(input);
    let mut computer = Computer {
        ip: 0,
        a: nums[0],
        b: nums[1],
        c: nums[2],
        program: &nums[3..],
    };
    let mut out = Vec::new();

    while let Some(n) = computer.run() {
        out.push(n);
    }

    out.iter()
        .map(|c| c.to_string())
        .collect::<Vec<String>>()
        .join(",")
}
```

## Part 2

The program is supposed to output another copy of the input program, but it doesn't,
because the input value in register A is corrupt.

The question asks what the lowest valid number for A is (so the program outputs another copy of itself).

My solution (which heavily uses some help I got in the [Rust Adventure](https://www.rustadventure.dev/) Discord) makes a few assumptions about the input and uses them.

- Your program ends in `3,0`.
That means at the end of the program the value of `a` must be 0.

- The initial values for `b` and `c` do not matter as they are set entirely based on the initial value in `a`.

- There is only one operation in the program that modifies `a`,  
and it is `a / (2 ** 3)`.
That's equivalent to `a >> 3`.

So I used backtracking to find the original value for `a`, given the program numbers.
The last valid value for `a` is `0`, because that's necessary for the program to end.

Starting with the last number the program should output and working backwards.
Each loop, I try to figure out what the previous number for `a` could have been given a valid value for `a` in the next loop,
and the number the program outputs.

I keep track of these possible valid values in a list, as each loop can result in multiple valid numbers `a` could have been.

I use the numbers in that list, call one `valid_next_a`, and I know that number is the result of `a >> 3`.

In other words:
`next_a = a >> 3`.

The value for `next_a` is known, so I try all possible values for `a` and see if they cause the correct program output.

That value the inverse of the operation + a number that has no inpact on the operation:
`a = (next_a << 3) + something_with_3_bits`

```rust
pub fn part_2(input: &str) -> u64 {
    let nums = parse(input);
    let program = &nums[3..];
    // a list of all valid values for a for the current step that causes the correct next number in
    // the program being output.
    // starts with [0] because a must be 0 at the end for the program to end
    // reason: at the end of the input there is a jnz instruction that jumps back to ip 0
    // (that means your program ends in 3,0)
    let mut valid = vec![0];

    // work backwards through the program to recreate it using known valid values for a that
    // produce the correct next output number in the program
    for &wanted in program.iter().rev() {
        let mut curr_valid = Vec::new();

        for valid_next_a in valid {
            // try all possible values n that recreate the new a, so the valid_next_a << 3 operation still has the same result
            for n in 0..8 {
                // the value in the a register is only changed once, it is divided by 2^3 (or
                // shifted right by 3)
                // shift valid_next_a 3 to the left, then add the n to get the original value for a
                let a = (valid_next_a << 3) | n;
                let mut computer = Computer {
                    ip: 0,
                    a,
                    // both b and c are set from the value in a so their starting value does not
                    // matter
                    b: 0,
                    c: 0,
                    program,
                };

                // if this program outputs the previous value in the program, the value for a was
                // correct
                if let Some(result) = computer.run() {
                    if result == wanted {
                        curr_valid.push(a);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        valid = curr_valid;
    }

    // the program is in the starting state now, so valid holds a list of valid numbers for the a
    // register that output the entire program at this point
    *valid.iter().min().unwrap()
}
```
