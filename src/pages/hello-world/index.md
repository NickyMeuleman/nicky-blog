# The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!

We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. It's only a model. No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart.

I dunno. Must be a king. On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. Burn her anyway! Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! __Help, help, I'm being repressed!__ *And the hat.* She's a witch!

## Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!

What a strange person. Who's that then? You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!

1. Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!
2. Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot!
3. The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!

### I dunno. Must be a king.

I'm not a witch. Why? Camelot! Well, I got better.

* Bring her forward!
* I'm not a witch.
* Well, she turned me into a newt.

The nose? I dunno. Must be a king. Why? Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Where'd you get the coconuts? Bloody Peasant!

No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! Well, I got better. Well, I got better. On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place.

You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! I am your king.

You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Oh, ow! Well, we did do the nose.

Burn her anyway! You don't vote for kings. Shut up! Will you shut up?! And the hat. She's a witch! And the hat. She's a witch!

You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! What do you mean? Shut up! Will you shut up?! Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!

Well, what do you want? You don't vote for kings. Where'd you get the coconuts? You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!

We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Now, look here, my good man. Why do you think that she is a witch? He hasn't got shit all over him. Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot!

What do you mean? Well, she turned me into a newt. Why do you think that she is a witch? Did you dress her up like this? Burn her anyway! I dunno. Must be a king.

Who's that then? Well, we did do the nose. Did you dress her up like this? Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! Why?

We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Well, she turned me into a newt. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
