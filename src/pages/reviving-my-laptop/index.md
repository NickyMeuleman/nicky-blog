A while ago I decided to start fresh and completely re√Ønstall this computer.
Three blog posts about me setting my trusty machine up again came out of that. _read [part1](/blog/fresh-development-environment-part-1/)_

I would like to tell you that decision came just because I felt like it but it didn't.
My laptop was getting hot, **very** hot.
After a while you collect a slew of cruft on your computer you'd be happier without. (looking at you, sponsor offers that installs a toolbar when you didn't uncheck that tiny box hiding in the corner of the installer)

I hoped that would help this laptop's thermal situation. It got so bad that it would throttle when only watching YouTube.
It only helped a bit, I could now use this machine for about an hour before I had to stop and do something else because I couldn't stand the constant heat anymore.

That's why I decided to completely disassemble this laptop and apply fresh thermal paste.
Luckily, I only needed very few tools.

I used:

* A screwdriver
* A prying tools (it was a nail file, but shhhh)
* Thermal paste
* Cups to organize all the screws
  * a pen to write labels for all those screws
