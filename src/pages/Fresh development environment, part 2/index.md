### installing Yarn

Lots of projects use the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager.
To install it head to the [install section in their docs](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) and follow the instructions for you operating system.

I'm on Windows, so I downloaded the latest stable installer and ran it.

Confirm the installation by checking the installed version

```bash
yarn --version
# 1.6.0
```
